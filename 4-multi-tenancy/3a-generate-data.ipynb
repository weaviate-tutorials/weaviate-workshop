In this paper, we\\nrecognize the dif\\ufb01culty of zero-shot learning\\nand encoding relevance. Instead, we pro-\\npose to pivot through Hy pothetical D ocument\\nEmbeddings ( HyDE ). Given a query, HyDE \\ufb01rst\\nzero-shot instructs an instruction-following\\nlanguage model (e.g. InstructGPT ) to gen-\\nerate a hypothetical document. The docu-\\nment captures relevance patterns but is unreal\\nand may contain false details. Then, an un-\\nsupervised contrastively learned encoder (e.g.\\nContriever ) encodes the document into an\\nembedding vector. This vector identi\\ufb01es a\\nneighborhood in the corpus embedding space,\\nwhere similar real documents are retrieved\\nbased on vector similarity. This second step\\nground the generated document to the actual\\ncorpus, with the encoder\\u2019s dense bottleneck\\n\\ufb01ltering out the incorrect details. Our exper-\\niments show that HyDE signi\\ufb01cantly outper-\\nforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised dense\\nretriever Contriever and shows strong per-\\nformance comparable to \\ufb01ne-tuned retrievers,\\nacross various tasks (e.g. web search, QA, fact\\nveri\\ufb01cation) and languages (e.g. sw, ko, ja).1\\n1 Introduction\\nDense retrieval (Lee et al., 2019; Karpukhin et al.,\\n2020), the method of retrieving documents using\\nsemantic embedding similarities, has been shown\\nsuccessful across tasks like web search, question\\nanswering, and fact veri\\ufb01cation. A variety of meth-\\nods such as negative mining (Xiong et al., 2021; Qu\\net al., 2021), distillation (Qu et al., 2021; Lin et al.,\\n2021b; Hofst\\u00e4tter et al., 2021) and task-speci\\ufb01c\\n\\u2217Equal contribution.\\n1No models were trained or \\ufb01ne-tuned in making this pre-\\nprint. Our open source code is available at https://github.\\ncom/texttron/hyde .pre-training (Izacard et al., 2021; Gao and Callan,\\n2021; Lu et al., 2021; Gao and Callan, 2022; Liu\\nand Shao, 2022) have been proposed to improve the\\neffectiveness of supervised dense retrieval models.\\nOn the other hand, zero-shot dense retrieval still\\nremains dif\\ufb01cult. Many recent works consider the\\nalternative transfer learning setup, where the dense\\nretrievers are trained on a high-resource dataset and\\nthen evaluated on queries from new tasks. The MS-\\nMARCO collection (Bajaj et al., 2016), a massive\\njudged dataset with a large number of judged query-\\ndocument pairs, is arguably the most commonly\\nused. As argued by Izacard et al. (2021), in prac-\\ntice, however, the existence of such a large dataset\\ncannot always be assumed. Even MS-MARCO re-\\nstricts commercial use and cannot be adopted in a\\nvariety of real-world search scenarios.\\nIn this paper, we aim to build effective fully\\nzero-shot dense retrieval systems that require no\\nrelevance supervision, work out-of-box and gener-\\nalize across tasks. As supervision is not available,\\nwe start by examining self-supervised representa-\\ntion learning methods. Modern deep learning en-\\nables two distinct learning algorithms. At the token\\nlevel, generative large language models (LLM) pre-\\ntrained on large corpus have demonstrated strong\\nnatural language understanding (NLU) and gen-\\neration (NLG) capabilities (Brown et al., 2020;\\nChen et al., 2021; Rae et al., 2021; Hoffmann\\net al., 2022; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Chowdhery\\net al., 2022). At the document level, text (chunk)\\nencoders pre-trained with contrastive objectives\\nlearn to encode document-document similarity into\\ninner-product (Izacard et al., 2021; Gao and Callan,\\n2022). On top of these, one extra insight into LLM\\nis borrowed: the LLMs further trained to follow\\ninstructions can zero-shot generalize to diverse un-\\nseen instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022; Sanh et al.,\\n2022; Min et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022).

HyDE serves all types of queries\\nwithout changing the underlying GPT-3 andContriever /mContriever models.\\nto human intent to follow instructions.\\nWith these ingredients, we propose to\\npivot through Hypothetical Document\\nEmbeddings ( HyDE ), and decompose dense\\nretrieval into two tasks, a generative task per-\\nformed by an instruction-following language\\nmodel and a document-document similarity task\\nperformed by a contrastive encoder (Figure 1).\\nFirst, we feed the query to the generative model\\nand instruct it to \\\"write a document that answers\\nthe question\\\", i.e. a hypothetical document.\\nWe expect the generative process to capture\\n\\\"relevance\\\" by giving an example; the generated\\ndocument is not real, can contain factual errors but\\nis like a relevant document. In the second step,\\nwe use an unsupervised contrastive encoder to\\nencode this document into an embedding vector.\\nHere, we expect the encoder\\u2019s dense bottleneck\\nto serve a lossy compressor, where the extra\\n(hallucinated) details are \\ufb01ltered out from the\\nembedding. We use this vector to search against\\nthe corpus embeddings. The most similar real\\ndocuments are retrieved and returned. The retrieval\\nleverages document-document similarity encoded\\nin the inner-product during contrastive training.\\nNote that, interestingly, with HyDE factorization,\\nthe query-document similarity score is no longer\\nexplicitly modeled nor computed. Instead, the\\nretrieval task is cast into two NLU and NLG tasks.\\nHyDE appears unsupervised. Nomodel is trained\\ninHyDE : both the generative model and the con-\\ntrastive encoder remain intact. Supervision signals\\nwere only involved in instruction learning of our\\nbackbone LLM.\\nIn our experiments, we show HyDE using Instruct-\\nGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) and Contriever (Izacard\\net al., 2021) as backbone models signi\\ufb01cantly out-\\nperforms the previous state-of-the-art Contriever-\\nonly zero-shot no-relevance system on 11 queriessets, covering tasks like Web Search, Question\\nAnswering, Fact Veri\\ufb01cation and languages like\\nSwahili, Korean, Japanese.\\n2 Related Works\\nDense Retrieval (Lee et al., 2019; Karpukhin\\net al., 2020) has been extensively studied after the\\nemergence of pre-trained Transformer language\\nmodels (Devlin et al., 2019). Researchers stud-\\nied the metric learning problems, such as training\\nloss (Karpukhin et al., 2020) and negative sam-\\npling (Xiong et al., 2021; Qu et al., 2021), and also\\nintroduced distillation (Qu et al., 2021; Lin et al.,\\n2021b; Hofst\\u00e4tter et al., 2021). Later works studied\\nthe second stage pre-training of language model\\nspeci\\ufb01cally for retrieval (Izacard et al., 2021; Gao\\nand Callan, 2021; Lu et al., 2021; Gao and Callan,\\n2022; Liu and Shao, 2022).\\nThe popularity of dense retrieval can be partially\\nattributed to the rich and successful research in very\\nef\\ufb01cient minimum inner product search (MIPS) at\\nvery large (billion) scales (Johnson et al., 2017).\\nInstructions-Following Language Models\\nSoon after the emergence of LLMs, several groups\\nof researchers discover that LLMs trained on data\\nconsisting of instructions and their execution can\\nzero-shot generalize to perform new tasks with new\\ninstructions (Ouyang et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022;\\nMin et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022). This can be\\ndone by standard supervised sequence-to-sequence\\nlearning or more effectively with reinforcement\\nlearning (Ouyang et al., 2022).\\nConcurrent to us, Asai et al. (2022) studied\\n\\u201cTask-aware Retrieval with Instructions\\u201d. They\\n\\ufb01ne-tuned dense encoders that can also encode\\ntask-speci\\ufb01c instruction prepended to query. In\\ncomparison, we use an unsupervised encoder and\\nhandle different tasks and their instruction with an\\ninstruction following generative LLM, as described\\nabove.\\nZero-Shot Dense Retrieval The tasks of zero-\\nshot (dense) retrieval are arguably empirically de-\\n\\ufb01ned by Thakur et al. (2021) for the neural re-\\ntrieval community. Their BEIR benchmark con-\\nsists of diverse retrieval tasks. The paper and\\nmany follow-up research generally consider the\\nTransfer Learning setup where the dense re-\\ntriever is \\ufb01rst learned using a diverse and richly\\nsupervised corpus and query collection, namely\\nMS-MARCO (Thakur et al., 2021; Wang et al.,\\n2022; Yu et al., 2022).\\nHowever, as stated by Izacard et al. (2021), such\\na large collection can rarely be assumed. In this\\npaper, therefore, we study the problem of building\\neffective dense retrieval systems without relevance\\nlabels. Similar to Izacard et al. (2021), we also\\ndo not assume access to the test time corpora for\\ntraining. This is a more realistic setup and prevents\\nover-engineering on the test corpora.\\nBy the de\\ufb01nition in Sachan et al. (2022), our\\nsetup can be roughly considered as \\u201cunsuper-\\nvised\\u201d . Strictly, as with Sachan et al. (2022), the\\nonly supervision resides in the LLM, in the pro-\\ncessing of learning to follow instructions.\\nGenerative Retrieval Generative search is a new\\nclass of retrieval methods that use neural generative\\nmodels as search indices (Metzler et al., 2021; Tay\\net al., 2022; Bevilacqua et al., 2022; Lee et al.,\\n2022). These models use (constrained) decoding\\nto generate document identi\\ufb01ers, such as id and\\nsub-string, which map directly to realdocuments.\\nThey have to go through special training procedures\\nover relevance data; effective search may also need\\nto use novel forms of search indices (Bevilacqua\\net al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022). In comparison, our\\nmethod uses the standard MIPS index and requires\\nno training or training data. Our generative model\\nproduces an intermediate hypothetical document\\nto be fed into a dense encoder, instead of a real\\ndocument.\\n3 Methodology\\nIn this section, we \\ufb01rst formally de\\ufb01ne the prob-\\nlem of (zero-shot) dense retrieval. Then we will\\nintroduce how HyDE is designed to solve it.3.1 Preliminaries\\nDense retrieval models similarity between query\\nand document with inner product similarity. Given\\na query qand document d, it uses two encoder\\nfunction encqandencdto map them into ddimen-\\nsion vectors vq,vd, whose inner product is used\\nas similarity measurement.\\nsim(q,d) =\\u27e8encq(q),encd(d)\\u27e9=\\u27e8vq,vd\\u27e9(1)\\nFor zero-shot retrieval, we consider Lquery sets\\nQ1, Q2, ..., Q Land their corresponding search cor-\\npus, document sets D1, D2, ..., D L. Denote the\\nj-th query from i-th set query set Qiasqij. We\\nneed to fully de\\ufb01ne mapping functions encqand\\nencdwithout access to any query set Qi, document\\nsetDi, or any relevance judgment rij.\\nThe dif\\ufb01culty of zero-shot dense retrieval lies\\nprecisely in Equation 1: it requires learning of two\\nembedding functions (for query and document re-\\nspectively) into the same embedding space where\\ninner product captures relevance . Without rele-\\nvance judgments/scores to \\ufb01t, learning becomes\\nintractable.\\n3.2 HyDE\\nHyDE circumvents the aforementioned learning\\nproblem by performing search in document-\\nonly embedding space that captures document-\\ndocument similarity. This can be easily learned\\nusing unsupervised contrastive learning (Izacard\\net al., 2021; Gao et al., 2021; Gao and Callan,\\n2022). We set document encoder encddirectly as a\\ncontrastive encoder enc con.\\nf=encd=enc con (2)\\nThis function is also denoted as ffor simplic-\\nity. This unsupervised contrastive encoder will\\nbe shared by all incoming document corpus.\\nvd=f(d)\\u2200d\\u2208D1\\u222aD2\\u222a...\\u222aDL (3)\\nTo build the query vector, we consider in addition\\nan instruction following LM, InstructLM. It takes a\\nquery qand a textual instruction INST and follows\\nthem to perform the task speci\\ufb01ed by INST . For\\nsimplicity, denote,\\ng(q,INST) =InstructLM (q,INST) (4)\\nNow we can use gto map queries to \\\"hypotheti-\\ncal\\\" documents by sampling from g, setting INST\\nto be\\u201cwrite a paragraph that answers the\\nquestion\\u201d . The generated document is not real,\\ncan and is likely to be ungrounded factually (Brown\\net al., 2020; Thoppilan et al., 2022). We only re-\\nquire it to capture relevance pattern. This is done\\nby generating documents, i.e. providing exam-\\nples. Critically, here we of\\ufb02oad relevance mod-\\neling from representation learning model to an\\nNLG model that generalizes signi\\ufb01cantly more eas-\\nily, naturally, and effectively (Brown et al., 2020;\\nOuyang et al., 2022). Generating examples also\\nreplaces explicit modeling of relevance scores.\\nWe can now encode the generated document using\\nthe document encoder f. Write,\\nE[vqij] =E[f(g(qij,INST i))] (5)\\nFormally, gde\\ufb01nes a probability distribution based\\non the chain rule. In this paper, we simply consider\\nthe expectation value, assuming the distribution of\\nvqijis uni-modal, i.e. the query is not ambiguous.\\nThe study of ambiguous queries and diversity is\\nleft to future work. We estimate Equation 5 by\\nsampling Ndocuments from g,[\\u02c6d1,\\u02c6d2, ...,\\u02c6dN].\\n\\u02c6vqij=1\\nN\\u2211\\n\\u02c6dk\\u223cg(qij,INST i)f(dk) (6)\\n=1\\nNN\\u2211\\nk=1f(\\u02c6dk) (7)\\nWe also consider the query as a possible hypothesis,\\n\\u02c6vqij=1\\nN+ 1[N\\u2211\\nk=1f(\\u02c6dk) +f(qij)] (8)\\nInner product is computed between \\u02c6vqijand the\\nset of all document vectors {f(d)|d\\u2208Di}. The\\nmost similar documents are retrieved. Here the\\nencoder function fserves as a lossy compressor\\nthat outputs dense vectors, where the extra details\\nare \\ufb01ltered and left out from the vector. It further\\ngrounds the hypothetical vector to the actual corpus\\nand the real documents. The full HyDE system is\\nillustrated in Figure 1.\\n4 Experiments\\n4.1 Setup\\nImplementation We implement HyDE using\\nInstructGPT , a GPT-3 model from the instruct\\nseries (text-davinci-003 ; Ouyang et al. (2022))\\nandContriever models (Izacard et al., 2021). Wesample from InstructGPT using the OpenAI play-\\nground default temperature of 0.7 for open-ended\\ngenerations. We use the English-only Contriever\\nmodel for English retrieval tasks and multilingual\\nmContriever for non-English tasks. We conducted\\nretrieval experiments with the Pyserini toolkit (Lin\\net al., 2021a).\\nDatasets We consider web search query sets\\nTREC DL19 (Craswell et al., 2020a) and\\nDL20 (Craswell et al., 2020b); they are based on\\nthe MS-MARCO dataset (Bajaj et al., 2016). We\\nalso use a diverse collection of 6 low-resource\\ndatasets from the BEIR dataset (Thakur et al.,\\n2021). For non-English retrieval, we consider\\nSwahili, Korean, Japanese, and Bengali from the\\nMr.Tydi dataset (Zhang et al., 2021).\\nWe use different instructions for each dataset.\\nThey share a similar structure but have different\\nquanti\\ufb01ers to control the exact form of the gener-\\nated hypothetical documents. These instructions\\ncan be found in subsection A.1.\\nCompared Systems Contriever models,\\nContriever andmContriever , serve as our major\\nbaseline. They are trained using unsupervised\\ncontrastive learning. HyDE retrievers share the\\nexact same embedding spaces with them. The\\nonly difference is how the query vector is built.\\nThese comparisons allow us to easily examine\\nthe effect of HyDE . The classical heuristic-based\\nlexical retriever BM25 is also included.\\nSeveral systems that involve \\ufb01ne-tuning on mas-\\nsive relevance data are also included as refer-\\nences. We consider models \\ufb01ne-tuned on MS-\\nMARCO and transferred, DPR and ANCE, from\\nthe BEIR paper. For multilingual, we include\\nthe mDPR model from Mr.Tydi paper and MS-\\nMARCO \\ufb01ne-tuned mBERT and XLM-R from\\nthe Contriever paper. We also include the state-of-\\nthe-art transfer learning models: Contriever and\\nmContriever \\ufb01ne-tuned on MS-MARCO, denoted\\nContrieverFTandmContrieverFT. These mod-\\nels have run through the state-of-the-art retrieval\\nmodel training pipeline that involves second-stage\\nretrieval-speci\\ufb01c pre-training (Lee et al., 2019) and\\na few rounds of \\ufb01ne-tuning (Qu et al., 2021); they\\nshould be considered empirical upper bounds.\\n4.2 Web Search\\nIn Table 1, we show retrieval results on TREC\\nDL19 and TREC DL20.

While\\nunsupervised Contriever can underperform the\\nclassical BM25 approach, HyDE outperforms BM25\\nby large margins.\\nHyDE remains competitive even when compared\\nto \\ufb01ne-tuned models. Note that TREC DL19/20\\nare search tasks de\\ufb01ned on MS-MARCO and\\nthere, all the \\ufb01ne-tuned models are richly super-\\nvised . On TREC DL19, HyDE shows comparable\\nmap and ndcg@10 to ContrieverFTand best re-\\ncall@1k. On DL20, HyDE gets around 10% lower\\nmap and ndcg@10 than ContrieverFTand sim-\\nilar recall@1k. The ANCE model shows better\\nndcg@10 numbers than HyDE but lower recall, sug-\\ngesting it may be biased to a subset of queries\\nand/or relevant documents.4.3 Low Resource Retrieval\\nIn Table 2, we show retrieval results on low-\\nresource tasks from BEIR. Similar to web\\nsearch,HyDE again brings sizable improvements to\\nContriever across the board in terms of both ndcg\\nand recall. HyDE is only outperformed by BM25 on\\none dataset, TREC-Covid but with a tiny 0.2 mar-\\ngin; in comparison, the underlying Contriever\\nunderperforms by more than 50%.\\nWe also observe HyDE demonstrates strong\\nperformance compared to \\ufb01ne-tuned models.\\nHyDE generally shows better performance than\\nANCE and DPR, even though the two are\\n\\ufb01ne-tuned on MS-MARCO and ANCE also in-\\nvolves some sophisticated hard negative techniques.\\nContrieverFTshows performance advantages on\\nFiQA and DBPedia.

The small-sized contrastive en-\\ncoder gets saturated as the number of languages\\nscales (Conneau et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2021).\\nMeanwhile, our generative LLM faces an opposite\\nissue: with languages of not as high resource as\\nEnglish or French, the high capacity LLM can get\\nunder-trained (Hoffmann et al., 2022).\\nNevertheless, in Table 3, we still \\ufb01nd HyDE\\nable to improve the mContriever model. It can\\noutperform non-Contriever models \\ufb01ne-tuned on\\nand transferred from MS-MARCO. On the other\\nhand, we do observe some margins between HyDE\\nand \\ufb01ne-tuned mContrieverFT. SinceHyDE and\\nmContrieverFTuse similar contrastive encoders,\\nwe hypothesize this is because the non-English lan-\\nguages we considered are under-trained in both\\npre-training and instruction learning stages.\\n5 Analysis\\nThe generative LLM and contrastive encoder make\\nup the backbone of HyDE . In this section, we study\\nthe effect of changing their realizations. In partic-\\nular, we consider smaller language models (LM)\\nand \\ufb01ne-tuned encoders. We conduct our studies\\non TREC DL19/20.\\n5.1 Effect of Different Generative Models\\nIn Table 4, we show HyDE using other\\ninstruction-following language models. In\\nparticular, we consider a 52-billion Cohere\\nmodel ( command-xlarge-20221108 ) and a\\n11-billion FLAN model ( FLAN-T5-xxl ; Wei\\net al. (2022)).2Generally, we observe that all\\n2Model sizes are from https://crfm.stanford.edu/\\nhelm/v1.0/?models .Model DL19 DL20\\nContriever 44.5 42.1\\nContrieverFT62.1 63.2\\nHyDE\\nw/ Contriever\\nw/ Flan-T5 (11b) 48.9 52.9\\nw/ Cohere (52b) 53.8 53.8\\nw/ GPT (175b) 61.3 57.9\\nw/ ContrieverFT\\nw/ Flan-T5 (11b) 60.2 62.1\\nw/ Cohere (52b) 61.4 63.1\\nw/ GPT (175b) 67.4 63.5\\nTable 4: NDCG@10 on TREC DL19/20. Effect\\nof changing different instruction LMs and using \\ufb01ne-\\ntuned encoder. Best w/o relevance and overall models\\nare marked bold .\\nmodels bring improvement to the unsupervised\\nContriever , with larger models bringing larger\\nimprovements. At the time when this paper is\\nwritten, the Cohere model is still experimental\\nwithout much detail disclosed. We can only\\ntentatively hypothesize that training techniques\\nmay have also played some role in the performance\\ndifference.\\n5.2 HyDE with Fine-tuned Encoder\\nTo begin with, HyDE with \\ufb01ne-tuned encoder is\\nnotthe intended usage: HyDE is more powerful\\nand irreplaceable when few relevance labels are\\npresent. Here we are interested to \\ufb01nd out if\\nand howHyDE embedding can affect \\ufb01ne-tuned en-\\ncoders. In Table 4, we see that less powerful instruc-\\ntion LMs can negatively impact the overall perfor-\\nmance of the \\ufb01ne-tuned retriever. (To remind our\\nreaders,ContrieverFTis in-domain supervisedly\\n\\ufb01ne-tuned for TREC DL19/20). The performance\\ndegradations remain small. On the other hand, we\\nalso observe the InstructGPT model able to fur-\\nther bring up the performance, especially on DL19.\\nThis suggests that there may still exist certain fac-\\ntors not captured by the \\ufb01ne-tuned encoder but only\\nby the generative model.\\n6 Conclusion\\nAt the end of the paper, we encourage the readers\\nto take a moment and re\\ufb02ect on the HyDE model.\\nCompare it to some of the other recently seen re-\\ntrievers or re-ranker. These other models probably\\ndiffer in their architecture, training method, and/or\\ntask, but probably all of them involve modeling\\nrelevance scores between a pair of query and docu-\\nment. Dense retrievers consider vector similarities\\nwhile self-attentive re-rankers regression scores. In\\ncomparison, the concept of relevance in HyDE is\\ncaptured by an NLG model and the language gener-\\nation process. We demonstrate in many cases, HyDE\\ncan be as effective as dense retrievers that learn to\\nmodel numerical relevance scores. So, is numeri-\\ncal relevance just a statistical artifact of language\\nunderstanding? Will a weak retriever theoretically\\nsuf\\ufb01ce as the NLU & NLG models rapidly become\\nstronger? Rushing to conclusions is not smart;\\nmore works need to be done to get answers. With\\nthis paper, we just want to raise these questions.\\nConcretely in this paper, we introduce a new\\nparadigm of interactions between LLM and dense\\nencoder/retriever. We demonstrate (part of) rel-\\nevance modeling and instruction understanding\\ncan be delegated to the more powerful and \\ufb02ex-\\nible LLM. As a consequence, the need for rele-\\nvance labels is removed. We are excited to see\\nhow this can be generalized further to more so-\\nphisticated tasks like multi-hop retrieval/QA and\\nconversational search.\\nWe argue HyDE is also of practical use though not\\nnecessarily over the entire lifespan of a search sys-\\ntem. At the very beginning of the life of the search\\nsystem, serving queries using HyDE offers perfor-\\nmance comparable to a \\ufb01ne-tuned model, which\\nno other relevance-free model can offer. As the\\nsearch log grows, a supervised dense retriever can\\nbe gradually rolled out. As the dense retriever\\ngrows stronger, more queries will be routed to it,\\nwith only less common and emerging ones going\\ntoHyDE backend.\\nReferences\\nAkari Asai, Timo Schick, Patrick Lewis, Xilun Chen,\\nGautier Izacard, Sebastian Riedel, Hannaneh Ha-\\njishirzi, and Wen-tau Yih. 2022.

In this paper, we recognize the dif\\ufb01culty of zero-shot learning and encoding relevance. Instead, we pro- pose to pivot through Hy pothetical D ocument Embeddings ( HyDE ). Given a query, HyDE \\ufb01rst zero-shot instructs an instruction-following language model (e.g. InstructGPT ) to gen- erate a hypothetical document. The docu- ment captures relevance patterns but is unreal and may contain false details. Then, an un- supervised contrastively learned encoder (e.g. Contriever ) encodes the document into an embedding vector. This vector identi\\ufb01es a neighborhood in the corpus embedding space, where similar real documents are retrieved based on vector similarity.

A variety of meth- ods such as negative mining (Xiong et al., 2021; Qu et al., 2021), distillation (Qu et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2021b; Hofst\\u00e4tter et al., 2021) and task-speci\\ufb01c \\u2217Equal contribution. 1No models were trained or \\ufb01ne-tuned in making this pre- print.

      "  \"zero-shot dense retrieval still remains dif\\ufb01cult. Many recent works consider the alternative transfer learning setup, where the dense retrievers are trained on a high-resource dataset and then evaluated on queries from new tasks. The MS- MARCO collection (Bajaj et al., 2016), a massive judged dataset with a large number of judged query- document pairs, is arguably the most commonly used. As argued by Izacard et al. (2021), in prac- tice, however, the existence of such a large dataset cannot always be assumed. Even MS-MARCO re- stricts commercial use and cannot be adopted in a variety of real-world search scenarios. In this paper, we aim to build effective fully zero-shot dense retrieval systems that require no relevance supervision, work out-of-box and gener- alize across tasks. As supervision is not available, we start by examining self-supervised representa- tion learning methods. Modern deep learning en- ables two distinct learning algorithms. At the token level, generative large language models (LLM) pre- trained on large corpus have demonstrated strong natural language understanding (NLU) and gen- eration (NLG) capabilities (Brown et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021; Rae et al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022). At the document level, text (chunk) encoders pre-trained with contrastive objectives learn to encode document-document similarity into inner-product (Izacard et al., 2021; Gao and Callan, 2022). On top of these, one extra insight into LLM is borrowed: the LLMs further trained to follow instructions can zero-shot generalize to diverse un- seen instructions (Ouyang\",\n",

With these ingredients, we propose to pivot through Hypothetical Document Embeddings ( HyDE ), and decompose dense retrieval into two tasks, a generative task per- formed by an instruction-following language model and a document-document similarity task performed by a contrastive encoder (Figure 1). First, we feed the query to the generative model and instruct it to \\\"write a document that answers the question\\\", i.e. a hypothetical document. We expect the generative process to capture \\\"relevance\\\" by giving an example; the generated document is not real, can contain factual errors but is like a relevant document. In the second step, we use an unsupervised contrastive encoder to encode this document into an embedding vector. Here, we expect the encoder\\u2019s dense bottleneck to serve a lossy compressor, where the extra (hallucinated) details are \\ufb01ltered out from the embedding. We use this vector to search against the corpus embeddings. The most similar real documents are retrieved and returned. The retrieval leverages document-document similarity encoded in the inner-product during contrastive training. Note that, interestingly, with HyDE factorization, the query-document similarity score is no longer explicitly modeled nor computed. Instead, the retrieval task is cast into two NLU and NLG tasks.\",\n",

Supervision signals were only involved in instruction learning of our backbone LLM. In our experiments, we show HyDE using Instruct- GPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) and Contriever (Izacard et al., 2021) as backbone models signi\\ufb01cantly out- performs the previous state-of-the-art Contriever- only zero-shot no-relevance system on 11 queriessets, covering tasks like Web Search, Question Answering, Fact Veri\\ufb01cation and languages like Swahili, Korean, Japanese. 2 Related Works Dense Retrieval (Lee et al., 2019; Karpukhin et al., 2020) has been extensively studied after the emergence of pre-trained Transformer language models (Devlin et al., 2019). Researchers stud- ied the metric learning problems, such as training loss (Karpukhin et al., 2020) and negative sam- pling (Xiong et al., 2021; Qu et al., 2021), and also introduced distillation (Qu et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2021b; Hofst\\u00e4tter et al., 2021).

The popularity of dense retrieval can be partially attributed to the rich and successful research in very ef\\ufb01cient minimum inner product search (MIPS) at very large (billion) scales (Johnson et al., 2017). Instructions-Following Language Models Soon after the emergence of LLMs, several groups of researchers discover that LLMs trained on data consisting of instructions and their execution can zero-shot generalize to perform new tasks with new instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Min et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022). This can be done by standard supervised sequence-to-sequence learning or more effectively with reinforcement learning (Ouyang et al., 2022). Concurrent to us, Asai et al. (2022) studied \\u201cTask-aware Retrieval with Instructions\\u201d. They \\ufb01ne-tuned dense encoders that can also encode task-speci\\ufb01c instruction prepended to query. In comparison, we use an unsupervised encoder and handle different tasks and their instruction with an instruction following generative LLM, as described above.

The paper and many follow-up research generally consider the Transfer Learning setup where the dense re- triever is \\ufb01rst learned using a diverse and richly supervised corpus and query collection, namely MS-MARCO (Thakur et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022). However, as stated by Izacard et al. (2021), such a large collection can rarely be assumed. In this paper, therefore, we study the problem of building effective dense retrieval systems without relevance labels. Similar to Izacard et al. (2021), we also do not assume access to the test time corpora for training. This is a more realistic setup and prevents over-engineering on the test corpora. By the de\\ufb01nition in Sachan et al. (2022), our setup can be roughly considered as \\u201cunsuper- vised\\u201d . Strictly, as with Sachan et al. (2022), the only supervision resides in the LLM, in the pro- cessing of learning to follow instructions. Generative Retrieval Generative search is a new class of retrieval methods that use neural generative models as search indices (Metzler et al., 2021; Tay et al., 2022; Bevilacqua et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022). These models use (constrained) decoding to generate document identi\\ufb01ers, such as id and sub-string, which map directly to realdocuments. They have to go through special training procedures over relevance data; effective search may also need to use novel forms of search indices (Bevilacqua\",\n",

They have to go through special training procedures over relevance data; effective search may also need to use novel forms of search indices (Bevilacqua et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022). In comparison, our method uses the standard MIPS index and requires no training or training data. Our generative model produces an intermediate hypothetical document to be fed into a dense encoder, instead of a real document. 3 Methodology In this section, we \\ufb01rst formally de\\ufb01ne the prob- lem of (zero-shot) dense retrieval. Then we will introduce how HyDE is designed to solve it.3.1 Preliminaries Dense retrieval models similarity between query and document with inner product similarity. Given a query qand document d, it uses two encoder function encqandencdto map them into ddimen- sion vectors vq,vd, whose inner product is used as similarity measurement. sim(q,d) =\\u27e8encq(q),encd(d)\\u27e9=\\u27e8vq,vd\\u27e9(1) For zero-shot retrieval, we consider Lquery sets Q1, Q2, ..., Q Land their corresponding search cor- pus, document sets D1, D2, ..., D L.

The dif\\ufb01culty of zero-shot dense retrieval lies precisely in Equation 1: it requires learning of two embedding functions (for query and document re- spectively) into the same embedding space where inner product captures relevance . Without rele- vance judgments/scores to \\ufb01t, learning becomes intractable. 3.2 HyDE HyDE circumvents the aforementioned learning problem by performing search in document- only embedding space that captures document- document similarity. This can be easily learned using unsupervised contrastive learning (Izacard et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2021; Gao and Callan, 2022). We set document encoder encddirectly as a contrastive encoder enc con. f=encd=enc con (2) This function is also denoted as ffor simplic- ity. This unsupervised contrastive encoder will be shared by all incoming document corpus. vd=f(d)\\u2200d\\u2208D1\\u222aD2\\u222a...\\u222aDL (3) To build the query vector, we consider in addition an instruction following LM, InstructLM. It takes a query qand a textual instruction INST and follows them to perform the task speci\\ufb01ed by INST . For simplicity, denote, g(q,INST) =InstructLM (q,INST) (4) Now we can use gto map queries to \\\"hypotheti- cal\\\" documents by sampling from g, setting INST to be\\u201cwrite a paragraph that answers the question\\u201d .

In this paper, we simply consider the expectation value, assuming the distribution of vqijis uni-modal, i.e. the query is not ambiguous. The study of ambiguous queries and diversity is left to future work.

We use the English-only Contriever model for English retrieval tasks and multilingual mContriever for non-English tasks. We conducted retrieval experiments with the Pyserini toolkit (Lin et al., 2021a). Datasets We consider web search query sets TREC DL19 (Craswell et al., 2020a) and DL20 (Craswell et al., 2020b); they are based on the MS-MARCO dataset (Bajaj et al., 2016). We also use a diverse collection of 6 low-resource datasets from the BEIR dataset (Thakur et al., 2021). For non-English retrieval, we consider Swahili, Korean, Japanese, and Bengali from the Mr.Tydi dataset (Zhang et al., 2021). We use different instructions for each dataset.

The small-sized contrastive en- coder gets saturated as the number of languages scales (Conneau et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2021). Meanwhile, our generative LLM faces an opposite issue: with languages of not as high resource as English or French, the high capacity LLM can get under-trained (Hoffmann et al., 2022).

We conduct our studies on TREC DL19/20. 5.1 Effect of Different Generative Models In Table 4, we show HyDE using other instruction-following language models. In particular, we consider a 52-billion Cohere model ( command-xlarge-20221108 ) and a 11-billion FLAN model ( FLAN-T5-xxl ; Wei et al.

Here we are interested to \\ufb01nd out if and howHyDE embedding can affect \\ufb01ne-tuned en- coders. In Table 4, we see that less powerful instruc- tion LMs can negatively impact the overall perfor- mance of the \\ufb01ne-tuned retriever.

On the other hand, we also observe the InstructGPT model able to fur- ther bring up the performance, especially on DL19.

Compare it to some of the other recently seen re- trievers or re-ranker. These other models probably differ in their architecture, training method, and/or task, but probably all of them involve modeling relevance scores between a pair of query and docu- ment. Dense retrievers consider vector similarities while self-attentive re-rankers regression scores. In comparison, the concept of relevance in HyDE is captured by an NLG model and the language gener- ation process. We demonstrate in many cases, HyDE can be as effective as dense retrievers that learn to model numerical relevance scores. So, is numeri- cal relevance just a statistical artifact of language understanding? Will a weak retriever theoretically suf\\ufb01ce as the NLU & NLG models rapidly become stronger? Rushing to conclusions is not smart; more works need to be done to get answers. With this paper, we just want to raise these questions. Concretely in this paper, we introduce a new paradigm of interactions between LLM and dense encoder/retriever. We demonstrate (part of) rel- evance modeling and instruction understanding can be delegated to the more powerful and \\ufb02ex- ible LLM. As a consequence, the need for rele- vance labels is removed. We are excited to see how this can be generalized further to more so- phisticated tasks like multi-hop retrieval/QA and conversational search.

We are excited to see how this can be generalized further to more so- phisticated tasks like multi-hop retrieval/QA and conversational search. We argue HyDE is also of practical use though not necessarily over the entire lifespan of a search sys- tem. At the very beginning of the life of the search system, serving queries using HyDE offers perfor- mance comparable to a \\ufb01ne-tuned model, which no other relevance-free model can offer. As the search log grows, a supervised dense retriever can be gradually rolled out. As the dense retriever grows stronger, more queries will be routed to it, with only less common and emerging ones going toHyDE backend.

Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo\\n{luyug, callan}@cs.cmu.edu, {x93ma, jimmylin}@uwaterloo.ca\\nAbstract\\nWhile dense retrieval has been shown effec-\\ntive and efﬁcient across tasks and languages,\\nit remains difﬁcult to create effective fully\\nzero-shot dense retrieval systems when no rel-\\nevance label is available. In this paper, we\\nrecognize the difﬁculty of zero-shot learning\\nand encoding relevance. Instead, we pro-\\npose to pivot through Hy pothetical D ocument\\nEmbeddings ( HyDE ). Given a query, HyDE ﬁrst\\nzero-shot instructs an instruction-following\\nlanguage model (e.g. InstructGPT ) to gen-\\nerate a hypothetical document. The docu-\\nment captures relevance patterns but is unreal\\nand may contain false details. Then, an un-\\nsupervised contrastively learned encoder (e.g.\\nContriever ) encodes the document into an\\nembedding vector. This vector identiﬁes a\\nneighborhood in the corpus embedding space,\\nwhere similar real documents are retrieved\\nbased on vector similarity. This second step\\nground the generated document to the actual\\ncorpus, with the encoder’s dense bottleneck\\nﬁltering out the incorrect details. Our exper-\\niments show that HyDE signiﬁcantly outper-\\nforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised dense\\nretriever Contriever and shows strong per-\\nformance comparable to ﬁne-tuned retrievers,\\nacross various tasks (e.g. web search, QA, fact\\nveriﬁcation) and languages (e.g. sw, ko, ja).1\\n1 Introduction\\nDense retrieval (Lee et al., 2019; Karpukhin et al.,\\n2020), the method of retrieving documents using\\nsemantic embedding similarities, has been shown\\nsuccessful across tasks like web search, question\\nanswering, and fact veriﬁcation. A variety of meth-\\nods such as negative mining (Xiong et al., 2021; Qu\\net al., 2021), distillation (Qu et al., 2021; Lin et al.,\\n2021b; Hofstätter et al., 2021) and task-speciﬁc\\n∗Equal contribution.\\n1No models were trained or ﬁne-tuned in making this pre-\\nprint. Our open source code is available at https://github.\\ncom/texttron/hyde .pre-training (Izacard et al., 2021; Gao and Callan,\\n2021; Lu et al., 2021; Gao and Callan, 2022; Liu\\nand Shao, 2022) have been proposed to improve the\\neffectiveness of supervised dense retrieval models.\\nOn the other hand, zero-shot dense retrieval still\\nremains difﬁcult. Many recent works consider the\\nalternative transfer learning setup, where the dense\\nretrievers are trained on a high-resource dataset and\\nthen evaluated on queries from new tasks. The MS-\\nMARCO collection (Bajaj et al., 2016), a massive\\njudged dataset with a large number of judged query-\\ndocument pairs, is arguably the most commonly\\nused. As argued by Izacard et al. (2021), in prac-\\ntice, however, the existence of such a large dataset\\ncannot always be assumed. Even MS-MARCO re-\\nstricts commercial use and cannot be adopted in a\\nvariety of real-world search scenarios.\\nIn this paper, we aim to build effective fully\\nzero-shot dense retrieval systems that require no\\nrelevance supervision, work out-of-box and gener-\\nalize across tasks. As supervision is not available,\\nwe start by examining self-supervised representa-\\ntion learning methods. Modern deep learning en-\\nables two distinct learning algorithms. At the token\\nlevel, generative large language models (LLM) pre-\\ntrained on large corpus have demonstrated strong\\nnatural language understanding (NLU) and gen-\\neration (NLG) capabilities (Brown et al., 2020;\\nChen et al., 2021; Rae et al., 2021; Hoffmann\\net al., 2022; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Chowdhery\\net al., 2022). At the document level, text (chunk)\\nencoders pre-trained with contrastive objectives\\nlearn to encode document-document similarity into\\ninner-product (Izacard et al., 2021; Gao and Callan,\\n2022). On top of these, one extra insight into LLM\\nis borrowed: the LLMs further trained to follow\\ninstructions can zero-shot generalize to diverse un-\\nseen instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022; Sanh et al.,\\n2022; Min et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022).

HyDE serves all types of queries\\nwithout changing the underlying GPT-3 andContriever /mContriever models.\\nto human intent to follow instructions.\\nWith these ingredients, we propose to\\npivot through Hypothetical Document\\nEmbeddings ( HyDE ), and decompose dense\\nretrieval into two tasks, a generative task per-\\nformed by an instruction-following language\\nmodel and a document-document similarity task\\nperformed by a contrastive encoder (Figure 1).\\nFirst, we feed the query to the generative model\\nand instruct it to \"write a document that answers\\nthe question\", i.e. a hypothetical document.\\nWe expect the generative process to capture\\n\"relevance\" by giving an example; the generated\\ndocument is not real, can contain factual errors but\\nis like a relevant document. In the second step,\\nwe use an unsupervised contrastive encoder to\\nencode this document into an embedding vector.\\nHere, we expect the encoder’s dense bottleneck\\nto serve a lossy compressor, where the extra\\n(hallucinated) details are ﬁltered out from the\\nembedding. We use this vector to search against\\nthe corpus embeddings. The most similar real\\ndocuments are retrieved and returned. The retrieval\\nleverages document-document similarity encoded\\nin the inner-product during contrastive training.\\nNote that, interestingly, with HyDE factorization,\\nthe query-document similarity score is no longer\\nexplicitly modeled nor computed. Instead, the\\nretrieval task is cast into two NLU and NLG tasks.\\nHyDE appears unsupervised. Nomodel is trained\\ninHyDE : both the generative model and the con-\\ntrastive encoder remain intact. Supervision signals\\nwere only involved in instruction learning of our\\nbackbone LLM.\\nIn our experiments, we show HyDE using Instruct-\\nGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) and Contriever (Izacard\\net al., 2021) as backbone models signiﬁcantly out-\\nperforms the previous state-of-the-art Contriever-\\nonly zero-shot no-relevance system on 11 queriessets, covering tasks like Web Search, Question\\nAnswering, Fact Veriﬁcation and languages like\\nSwahili, Korean, Japanese.\\n2 Related Works\\nDense Retrieval (Lee et al., 2019; Karpukhin\\net al., 2020) has been extensively studied after the\\nemergence of pre-trained Transformer language\\nmodels (Devlin et al., 2019). Researchers stud-\\nied the metric learning problems, such as training\\nloss (Karpukhin et al., 2020) and negative sam-\\npling (Xiong et al., 2021; Qu et al., 2021), and also\\nintroduced distillation (Qu et al., 2021; Lin et al.,\\n2021b; Hofstätter et al., 2021). Later works studied\\nthe second stage pre-training of language model\\nspeciﬁcally for retrieval (Izacard et al., 2021; Gao\\nand Callan, 2021; Lu et al., 2021; Gao and Callan,\\n2022; Liu and Shao, 2022).\\nThe popularity of dense retrieval can be partially\\nattributed to the rich and successful research in very\\nefﬁcient minimum inner product search (MIPS) at\\nvery large (billion) scales (Johnson et al., 2017).\\nInstructions-Following Language Models\\nSoon after the emergence of LLMs, several groups\\nof researchers discover that LLMs trained on data\\nconsisting of instructions and their execution can\\nzero-shot generalize to perform new tasks with new\\ninstructions (Ouyang et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022;\\nMin et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022). This can be\\ndone by standard supervised sequence-to-sequence\\nlearning or more effectively with reinforcement\\nlearning (Ouyang et al., 2022).\\nConcurrent to us, Asai et al. (2022) studied\\n“Task-aware Retrieval with Instructions”. They\\nﬁne-tuned dense encoders that can also encode\\ntask-speciﬁc instruction prepended to query. In\\ncomparison, we use an unsupervised encoder and\\nhandle different tasks and their instruction with an\\ninstruction following generative LLM, as described\\nabove.\\nZero-Shot Dense Retrieval The tasks of zero-\\nshot (dense) retrieval are arguably empirically de-\\nﬁned by Thakur et al. (2021) for the neural re-\\ntrieval community. Their BEIR benchmark con-\\nsists of diverse retrieval tasks. The paper and\\nmany follow-up research generally consider the\\nTransfer Learning setup where the dense re-\\ntriever is ﬁrst learned using a diverse and richly\\nsupervised corpus and query collection, namely\\nMS-MARCO (Thakur et al., 2021; Wang et al.,\\n2022; Yu et al., 2022).\\nHowever, as stated by Izacard et al. (2021), such\\na large collection can rarely be assumed. In this\\npaper, therefore, we study the problem of building\\neffective dense retrieval systems without relevance\\nlabels. Similar to Izacard et al. (2021), we also\\ndo not assume access to the test time corpora for\\ntraining. This is a more realistic setup and prevents\\nover-engineering on the test corpora.\\nBy the deﬁnition in Sachan et al. (2022), our\\nsetup can be roughly considered as “unsuper-\\nvised” . Strictly, as with Sachan et al. (2022), the\\nonly supervision resides in the LLM, in the pro-\\ncessing of learning to follow instructions.\\nGenerative Retrieval Generative search is a new\\nclass of retrieval methods that use neural generative\\nmodels as search indices (Metzler et al., 2021; Tay\\net al., 2022; Bevilacqua et al., 2022; Lee et al.,\\n2022). These models use (constrained) decoding\\nto generate document identiﬁers, such as id and\\nsub-string, which map directly to realdocuments.\\nThey have to go through special training procedures\\nover relevance data; effective search may also need\\nto use novel forms of search indices (Bevilacqua\\net al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022). In comparison, our\\nmethod uses the standard MIPS index and requires\\nno training or training data. Our generative model\\nproduces an intermediate hypothetical document\\nto be fed into a dense encoder, instead of a real\\ndocument.\\n3 Methodology\\nIn this section, we ﬁrst formally deﬁne the prob-\\nlem of (zero-shot) dense retrieval. Then we will\\nintroduce how HyDE is designed to solve it.3.1 Preliminaries\\nDense retrieval models similarity between query\\nand document with inner product similarity. Given\\na query qand document d, it uses two encoder\\nfunction encqandencdto map them into ddimen-\\nsion vectors vq,vd, whose inner product is used\\nas similarity measurement.\\nsim(q,d) =⟨encq(q),encd(d)⟩=⟨vq,vd⟩(1)\\nFor zero-shot retrieval, we consider Lquery sets\\nQ1, Q2, ..., Q Land their corresponding search cor-\\npus, document sets D1, D2, ..., D L. Denote the\\nj-th query from i-th set query set Qiasqij. We\\nneed to fully deﬁne mapping functions encqand\\nencdwithout access to any query set Qi, document\\nsetDi, or any relevance judgment rij.\\nThe difﬁculty of zero-shot dense retrieval lies\\nprecisely in Equation 1: it requires learning of two\\nembedding functions (for query and document re-\\nspectively) into the same embedding space where\\ninner product captures relevance . Without rele-\\nvance judgments/scores to ﬁt, learning becomes\\nintractable.\\n3.2 HyDE\\nHyDE circumvents the aforementioned learning\\nproblem by performing search in document-\\nonly embedding space that captures document-\\ndocument similarity. This can be easily learned\\nusing unsupervised contrastive learning (Izacard\\net al., 2021; Gao et al., 2021; Gao and Callan,\\n2022). We set document encoder encddirectly as a\\ncontrastive encoder enc con.\\nf=encd=enc con (2)\\nThis function is also denoted as ffor simplic-\\nity. This unsupervised contrastive encoder will\\nbe shared by all incoming document corpus.\\nvd=f(d)∀d∈D1∪D2∪...∪DL (3)\\nTo build the query vector, we consider in addition\\nan instruction following LM, InstructLM. It takes a\\nquery qand a textual instruction INST and follows\\nthem to perform the task speciﬁed by INST . For\\nsimplicity, denote,\\ng(q,INST) =InstructLM (q,INST) (4)\\nNow we can use gto map queries to \"hypotheti-\\ncal\" documents by sampling from g, setting INST\\nto be“write a paragraph that answers the\\nquestion” . The generated document is not real,\\ncan and is likely to be ungrounded factually (Brown\\net al., 2020; Thoppilan et al., 2022). We only re-\\nquire it to capture relevance pattern. This is done\\nby generating documents, i.e. providing exam-\\nples. Critically, here we ofﬂoad relevance mod-\\neling from representation learning model to an\\nNLG model that generalizes signiﬁcantly more eas-\\nily, naturally, and effectively (Brown et al., 2020;\\nOuyang et al., 2022). Generating examples also\\nreplaces explicit modeling of relevance scores.\\nWe can now encode the generated document using\\nthe document encoder f. Write,\\nE[vqij] =E[f(g(qij,INST i))] (5)\\nFormally, gdeﬁnes a probability distribution based\\non the chain rule. In this paper, we simply consider\\nthe expectation value, assuming the distribution of\\nvqijis uni-modal, i.e. the query is not ambiguous.\\nThe study of ambiguous queries and diversity is\\nleft to future work. We estimate Equation 5 by\\nsampling Ndocuments from g,[ˆd1,ˆd2, ...,ˆdN].\\nˆvqij=1\\nN∑\\nˆdk∼g(qij,INST i)f(dk) (6)\\n=1\\nNN∑\\nk=1f(ˆdk) (7)\\nWe also consider the query as a possible hypothesis,\\nˆvqij=1\\nN+ 1[N∑\\nk=1f(ˆdk) +f(qij)] (8)\\nInner product is computed between ˆvqijand the\\nset of all document vectors {f(d)|d∈Di}. The\\nmost similar documents are retrieved. Here the\\nencoder function fserves as a lossy compressor\\nthat outputs dense vectors, where the extra details\\nare ﬁltered and left out from the vector. It further\\ngrounds the hypothetical vector to the actual corpus\\nand the real documents. The full HyDE system is\\nillustrated in Figure 1.\\n4 Experiments\\n4.1 Setup\\nImplementation We implement HyDE using\\nInstructGPT , a GPT-3 model from the instruct\\nseries (text-davinci-003 ; Ouyang et al. (2022))\\nandContriever models (Izacard et al., 2021). Wesample from InstructGPT using the OpenAI play-\\nground default temperature of 0.7 for open-ended\\ngenerations. We use the English-only Contriever\\nmodel for English retrieval tasks and multilingual\\nmContriever for non-English tasks. We conducted\\nretrieval experiments with the Pyserini toolkit (Lin\\net al., 2021a).\\nDatasets We consider web search query sets\\nTREC DL19 (Craswell et al., 2020a) and\\nDL20 (Craswell et al., 2020b); they are based on\\nthe MS-MARCO dataset (Bajaj et al., 2016). We\\nalso use a diverse collection of 6 low-resource\\ndatasets from the BEIR dataset (Thakur et al.,\\n2021). For non-English retrieval, we consider\\nSwahili, Korean, Japanese, and Bengali from the\\nMr.Tydi dataset (Zhang et al., 2021).\\nWe use different instructions for each dataset.\\nThey share a similar structure but have different\\nquantiﬁers to control the exact form of the gener-\\nated hypothetical documents. These instructions\\ncan be found in subsection A.1.\\nCompared Systems Contriever models,\\nContriever andmContriever , serve as our major\\nbaseline. They are trained using unsupervised\\ncontrastive learning. HyDE retrievers share the\\nexact same embedding spaces with them. The\\nonly difference is how the query vector is built.\\nThese comparisons allow us to easily examine\\nthe effect of HyDE . The classical heuristic-based\\nlexical retriever BM25 is also included.\\nSeveral systems that involve ﬁne-tuning on mas-\\nsive relevance data are also included as refer-\\nences. We consider models ﬁne-tuned on MS-\\nMARCO and transferred, DPR and ANCE, from\\nthe BEIR paper. For multilingual, we include\\nthe mDPR model from Mr.Tydi paper and MS-\\nMARCO ﬁne-tuned mBERT and XLM-R from\\nthe Contriever paper. We also include the state-of-\\nthe-art transfer learning models: Contriever and\\nmContriever ﬁne-tuned on MS-MARCO, denoted\\nContrieverFTandmContrieverFT. These mod-\\nels have run through the state-of-the-art retrieval\\nmodel training pipeline that involves second-stage\\nretrieval-speciﬁc pre-training (Lee et al., 2019) and\\na few rounds of ﬁne-tuning (Qu et al., 2021); they\\nshould be considered empirical upper bounds.\\n4.2 Web Search\\nIn Table 1, we show retrieval results on TREC\\nDL19 and TREC DL20.

The ANCE model shows better\\nndcg@10 numbers than HyDE but lower recall, sug-\\ngesting it may be biased to a subset of queries\\nand/or relevant documents.4.3 Low Resource Retrieval\\nIn Table 2, we show retrieval results on low-\\nresource tasks from BEIR. Similar to web\\nsearch,HyDE again brings sizable improvements to\\nContriever across the board in terms of both ndcg\\nand recall. HyDE is only outperformed by BM25 on\\none dataset, TREC-Covid but with a tiny 0.2 mar-\\ngin; in comparison, the underlying Contriever\\nunderperforms by more than 50%.\\nWe also observe HyDE demonstrates strong\\nperformance compared to ﬁne-tuned models.\\nHyDE generally shows better performance than\\nANCE and DPR, even though the two are\\nﬁne-tuned on MS-MARCO and ANCE also in-\\nvolves some sophisticated hard negative techniques.\\nContrieverFTshows performance advantages on\\nFiQA and DBPedia.

The small-sized contrastive en-\\ncoder gets saturated as the number of languages\\nscales (Conneau et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2021).\\nMeanwhile, our generative LLM faces an opposite\\nissue: with languages of not as high resource as\\nEnglish or French, the high capacity LLM can get\\nunder-trained (Hoffmann et al., 2022).\\nNevertheless, in Table 3, we still ﬁnd HyDE\\nable to improve the mContriever model. It can\\noutperform non-Contriever models ﬁne-tuned on\\nand transferred from MS-MARCO. On the other\\nhand, we do observe some margins between HyDE\\nand ﬁne-tuned mContrieverFT. SinceHyDE and\\nmContrieverFTuse similar contrastive encoders,\\nwe hypothesize this is because the non-English lan-\\nguages we considered are under-trained in both\\npre-training and instruction learning stages.\\n5 Analysis\\nThe generative LLM and contrastive encoder make\\nup the backbone of HyDE . In this section, we study\\nthe effect of changing their realizations. In partic-\\nular, we consider smaller language models (LM)\\nand ﬁne-tuned encoders. We conduct our studies\\non TREC DL19/20.\\n5.1 Effect of Different Generative Models\\nIn Table 4, we show HyDE using other\\ninstruction-following language models. In\\nparticular, we consider a 52-billion Cohere\\nmodel ( command-xlarge-20221108 ) and a\\n11-billion FLAN model ( FLAN-T5-xxl ; Wei\\net al. (2022)).2Generally, we observe that all\\n2Model sizes are from https://crfm.stanford.edu/\\nhelm/v1.0/?models .Model DL19 DL20\\nContriever 44.5 42.1\\nContrieverFT62.1 63.2\\nHyDE\\nw/ Contriever\\nw/ Flan-T5 (11b) 48.9 52.9\\nw/ Cohere (52b) 53.8 53.8\\nw/ GPT (175b) 61.3 57.9\\nw/ ContrieverFT\\nw/ Flan-T5 (11b) 60.2 62.1\\nw/ Cohere (52b) 61.4 63.1\\nw/ GPT (175b) 67.4 63.5\\nTable 4: NDCG@10 on TREC DL19/20.

At the time when this paper is\\nwritten, the Cohere model is still experimental\\nwithout much detail disclosed. We can only\\ntentatively hypothesize that training techniques\\nmay have also played some role in the performance\\ndifference.\\n5.2 HyDE with Fine-tuned Encoder\\nTo begin with, HyDE with ﬁne-tuned encoder is\\nnotthe intended usage: HyDE is more powerful\\nand irreplaceable when few relevance labels are\\npresent. Here we are interested to ﬁnd out if\\nand howHyDE embedding can affect ﬁne-tuned en-\\ncoders. In Table 4, we see that less powerful instruc-\\ntion LMs can negatively impact the overall perfor-\\nmance of the ﬁne-tuned retriever. (To remind our\\nreaders,ContrieverFTis in-domain supervisedly\\nﬁne-tuned for TREC DL19/20). The performance\\ndegradations remain small. On the other hand, we\\nalso observe the InstructGPT model able to fur-\\nther bring up the performance, especially on DL19.\\nThis suggests that there may still exist certain fac-\\ntors not captured by the ﬁne-tuned encoder but only\\nby the generative model.\\n6 Conclusion\\nAt the end of the paper, we encourage the readers\\nto take a moment and reﬂect on the HyDE model.\\nCompare it to some of the other recently seen re-\\ntrievers or re-ranker. These other models probably\\ndiffer in their architecture, training method, and/or\\ntask, but probably all of them involve modeling\\nrelevance scores between a pair of query and docu-\\nment. Dense retrievers consider vector similarities\\nwhile self-attentive re-rankers regression scores. In\\ncomparison, the concept of relevance in HyDE is\\ncaptured by an NLG model and the language gener-\\nation process. We demonstrate in many cases, HyDE\\ncan be as effective as dense retrievers that learn to\\nmodel numerical relevance scores. So, is numeri-\\ncal relevance just a statistical artifact of language\\nunderstanding? Will a weak retriever theoretically\\nsufﬁce as the NLU & NLG models rapidly become\\nstronger? Rushing to conclusions is not smart;\\nmore works need to be done to get answers. With\\nthis paper, we just want to raise these questions.\\nConcretely in this paper, we introduce a new\\nparadigm of interactions between LLM and dense\\nencoder/retriever. We demonstrate (part of) rel-\\nevance modeling and instruction understanding\\ncan be delegated to the more powerful and ﬂex-\\nible LLM. As a consequence, the need for rele-\\nvance labels is removed. We are excited to see\\nhow this can be generalized further to more so-\\nphisticated tasks like multi-hop retrieval/QA and\\nconversational search.\\nWe argue HyDE is also of practical use though not\\nnecessarily over the entire lifespan of a search sys-\\ntem. At the very beginning of the life of the search\\nsystem, serving queries using HyDE offers perfor-\\nmance comparable to a ﬁne-tuned model, which\\nno other relevance-free model can offer. As the\\nsearch log grows, a supervised dense retriever can\\nbe gradually rolled out. As the dense retriever\\ngrows stronger, more queries will be routed to it,\\nwith only less common and emerging ones going\\ntoHyDE backend.\\nReferences\\nAkari Asai, Timo Schick, Patrick Lewis, Xilun Chen,\\nGautier Izacard, Sebastian Riedel, Hannaneh Ha-\\njishirzi, and Wen-tau Yih. 2022.

Then, an un- supervised contrastively learned encoder (e.g. Contriever ) encodes the document into an embedding vector.

With these ingredients, we propose to pivot through Hypothetical Document Embeddings ( HyDE ), and decompose dense retrieval into two tasks, a generative task per- formed by an instruction-following language model and a document-document similarity task performed by a contrastive encoder (Figure 1). First, we feed the query to the generative model and instruct it to \"write a document that answers the question\", i.e. a hypothetical document.

Instructions-Following Language Models Soon after the emergence of LLMs, several groups of researchers discover that LLMs trained on data consisting of instructions and their execution can zero-shot generalize to perform new tasks with new instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Min et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022).

However, as stated by Izacard et al. (2021), such a large collection can rarely be assumed. In this paper, therefore, we study the problem of building effective dense retrieval systems without relevance labels. Similar to Izacard et al. (2021), we also do not assume access to the test time corpora for training. This is a more realistic setup and prevents over-engineering on the test corpora. By the deﬁnition in Sachan et al. (2022), our setup can be roughly considered as “unsuper- vised” . Strictly,',\n",

(2022), the only supervision resides in the LLM, in the pro- cessing of learning to follow instructions. Generative Retrieval Generative search is a new class of retrieval methods that use neural generative models as search indices (Metzler et al., 2021; Tay et al., 2022; Bevilacqua et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022). These models use (constrained) decoding to generate document identiﬁers, such as id and sub-string, which map directly to realdocuments. They have to go through special training procedures over relevance data; effective search may also need to use novel forms of search indices (Bevilacqua',\n",

They have to go through special training procedures over relevance data; effective search may also need to use novel forms of search indices (Bevilacqua et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2022). In comparison, our method uses the standard MIPS index and requires no training or training data. Our generative model produces an intermediate hypothetical document to be fed into a dense encoder, instead of a real document. 3 Methodology In this section, we ﬁrst formally deﬁne the prob- lem of (zero-shot) dense retrieval. Then we will introduce how HyDE is designed to solve it.3.1 Preliminaries Dense retrieval models similarity between query and document with inner product similarity.

Denote the j-th query from i-th set query set Qiasqij. We need to fully deﬁne mapping functions encqand encdwithout access to any query set Qi, document setDi, or any relevance judgment rij.

Without rele- vance judgments/scores to ﬁt, learning becomes intractable. 3.2 HyDE HyDE circumvents the aforementioned learning problem by performing search in document- only embedding space that captures document- document similarity. This can be easily learned using unsupervised contrastive learning (Izacard et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2021; Gao and Callan, 2022). We set document encoder encddirectly as a contrastive encoder enc con. f=encd=enc con (2) This function is also denoted as ffor simplic- ity.

It takes a query qand a textual instruction INST and follows them to perform the task speciﬁed by INST . For simplicity, denote, g(q,INST) =InstructLM (q,INST) (4) Now we can use gto map queries to \"hypotheti- cal\" documents by sampling from g, setting INST to be“write a paragraph that answers the question” . The generated document is not real, can and is likely to be ungrounded factually (Brown et al., 2020; Thoppilan et al., 2022). We only re- quire it to capture relevance pattern.

Generating examples also replaces explicit modeling of relevance scores. We can now encode the generated document using the document encoder f. Write, E[vqij] =E[f(g(qij,INST i))] (5) Formally, gdeﬁnes a probability distribution based on the chain rule.

Here we are interested to ﬁnd out if and howHyDE embedding can affect ﬁne-tuned en- coders. In Table 4, we see that less powerful instruc- tion LMs can negatively impact the overall perfor- mance of the ﬁne-tuned retriever.

On the other hand, we also observe the InstructGPT model able to fur- ther bring up the performance, especially on DL19. This suggests that there may still exist certain fac- tors not captured by the ﬁne-tuned encoder but only by the generative model. 6 Conclusion At the end of the paper, we encourage the readers to take a moment and reﬂect on the HyDE model.

These other models probably differ in their architecture, training method, and/or task, but probably all of them involve modeling relevance scores between a pair of query and docu- ment. Dense retrievers consider vector similarities while self-attentive re-rankers regression scores. In comparison, the concept of relevance in HyDE is captured by an NLG model and the language gener- ation process. We demonstrate in many cases, HyDE can be as effective as dense retrievers that learn to model numerical relevance scores.

We demonstrate (part of) rel- evance modeling and instruction understanding can be delegated to the more powerful and ﬂex- ible LLM. As a consequence, the need for rele- vance labels is removed.

As the search log grows, a supervised dense retriever can be gradually rolled out. As the dense retriever grows stronger, more queries will be routed to it, with only less common and emerging ones going toHyDE backend.
