Simulations of quantum systems in finite volume have proven to be a useful tool for calculating
physical observables. Such studies to date have focused primarily on understanding the volume
dependence of binding energies, from which it is possible to extract asymptotic properties of the
corresponding bound state, as well as on extracting scattering information. For bound states, all
properties depend on the size of the finite volume, and for precision studies it is important to
understand such effects. In this work, we therefore derive the volume dependence of the mean
squared radius of a two-body bound state, using a technique that can be generalized to other static
properties in the future. We test our results with explicit numerical examples and demonstrate that
we can robustly extract infinite-volume radii from finite-volume simulations in cubic boxes with
periodic boundary conditions.
I. INTRODUCTION
Finite-volume (FV) simulations of quantum systems in
periodic cubic boxes are a powerful tool that is used to
study properties of nuclear bound states and scattering.
A series of highly influential papers [1–3] established in
the 1980s and 90s that real-world properties of a quan-
tum system are encoded in how its discrete energy levels
change as volume size is varied. Over the past decades,
this fruitful idea has spurred a lot of activity, with re-
cent focus on the study of three-body systems [4–22],
motivated primarily by applications to Lattice Quantum
Chromodynamics (Lattice QCD). For two-cluster bound
states, the volume dependence of the binding energy is
known for an arbitrary number of constituents [23]. Re-
cent work derived the volume dependence of two-body
bound states comprised of charged particles, with full
nonperturbative account for the repulsive Coulomb in-
teraction [24], and Ref. [25] extended the method to res-
onances. An important motivation for understanding the
volume dependence of bound states is that knowledge of
the functional form makes it possible to extract asymp-
totic normalization coefficients (ANCs) from FV calcula-
tions, for example based on Lattice Effective Field The-
ory (Lattice EFT) simulations of atomic nuclei [26–30].
In this paper, we extend studies of the volume depen-
dence for bound states beyond what is known for bind-
ing energies. As simplest observable, we consider mean
squared radii, ⟨r2⟩, of two-body bound states, defined (in
more detail in the following section) as the expectation
value of an operator that measures the average distance
of the constituents from their common center of mass.
Just like the binding energy, ⟨r2⟩will be shifted from its
physical value in FV, and the magnitude of this shift can
be traced back to changes in the wave function induced
by being confined to a periodic box. We derive in de-
tail the functional form of the radius finite-volume shift,
which makes it possible to perform extrapolations from
∗ajtauren@ncsu.edu
†skoenig@ncsu.edua set of finite-volume calculations to the real world, i.e.,
infinite volume.
Unlike the binding energy, which is known to depend,
to leading exponential order, only on asymptotic prop-
erties of the wave function (and is thus universal with
respect to the details of the short-range interaction that
gives rise to the bound state [1, 23, 24, 31, 32]), one
should expect ⟨r2⟩to be sensitive in principle to the form
of the wave function at all relative distances. This has
indeed been observed for radii and other static proper-
ties of bounds states calculated in truncated harmonic
oscillator bases [33–35].
We derive in this work analytical expressions for the
leading volume dependence of the mean-squared radius
for two-body states bound by a short-range interaction.
Based on an appropriate ansatz for the relevant volume
dependence of the wave function, we obtain explicit for-
mulas for states within the A+
1andT−
1representations
of the cubic symmetry group, which correspond approx-
imately to S- and P-wave states in infinite volume. A
constructive prescription is given for the general case.
Our results are relevant for example for Lattice QCD
studies of the deuteron radius, and the formalism we de-
velop paves the way for deriving analogous relations for
other static observables, as well as for bound states com-
prised of more than two particles. Relations of this form
will have applications not only in Lattice QCD studies of
multi-nucleon bound states, but also to precision studies
of atomic nuclei with Lattice EFT.
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we de-
velop the formalism for deriving the finite-volume radius
shift ∆
r2
(L), starting with a discussion of how the
bound-state wave function changes when it is confined
to the periodic box. Subsequently, in Sec. III we present
closed-form analytical expressions that describe the ra-
dius shift for bound states within the A+
1andT−
1cubic
representations and we verify these the results with ex-
plicit numerical calculations. Finally, in Sec. IV we close
with a summary and outlook.arXiv:2401.00107v1  [nucl-th]  30 Dec 2023

II. FORMALISM
A. General setup in infinite volume
We consider a system of two particles with reduced
mass µand relative coordinate denoted rinteracting via
a finite-range, spherically symmetric potential, i.e., for
R >0 and
B=
x∈R3:|x| ≤R	
, (1)
it holds that
V(r,r′) = 0 if r,r′/∈B , (2)
andVdepends only on the magnitude of randr′. To
be as general as possible, we allow Vto have a nonlocal
form and we emphasize that our main results to do not
depend on the detailed form of V(r,r′). We furthermore
note that although for convenience we assume a strict
finite range Rin the following, our results remain valid
with negligible corrections for short-range potentials that
fall off faster than any power law at large distances.
We write the Schr¨ odinger equation for a state |ψ⟩as
ˆH|ψ⟩=E|ψ⟩, (3)
with the Hamiltonian given by
ˆHψ(r) =−1
2µ∇2ψ(r) +Z
d3r′V(r,r′)ψ(r′).(4)
We define |ψ∞⟩to be a solution with positive binding
energy E∞such that
ˆH|ψ∞⟩=−E∞|ψ∞⟩. (5)
Forr/∈Bthe Hamiltonian simplifies to
ˆHψ(r)r/∈B=−1
2µ∇2ψ(r) (6)
and we can write the asymptotic wave function as
ψ∞(r)r/∈B≡ψ∞,asm(r) =−iℓγh(1)
ℓ(iκr)Ym
ℓ(r/r),(7)
where h(1)
ℓis the spherical Hankel function of the first
kind and
κ2= 2µE∞. (8)
The asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) γis
fixed via the normalization condition ⟨ψ∞|ψ∞⟩= 1 and
Eq. (??). For later use we also define a state |ψE,asm⟩
to be the purely asymptotic form of a bound state with
binding energy E, satisfying
ˆHψE,asm(r)r/∈B=−EψE,asm(r). (9)
We are not making any assumption here about the be-
havior of ψE,asm(r) forr∈Band just note that in all
applications ψE,asmwill be multiplied by an indicator
function that is zero for r∈B.B. Finite-volume wave function
Now we consider the same system confined to a cu-
bic periodic box of edge length L≫R. The potential
becomes periodic, taking the form
VL(r,r′) =X
nV(r+nL,r′+nL), (10)
and it satisfies
VL(r,r′) = 0 if r∈Aorr′∈A , (11)
where A, called the asymptotic domain, is defined as
A=
x∈R3: (x+nL)/∈B∀n∈Z3	
. (12)
The action of the finite-volume Hamiltonian on a generic
state|ψ⟩, written in configuration space, is then
ˆHLψ(r) =−1
2µ∇2ψ(r) +Z
d3r′VL(r,r′)ψ(r′)
=ˆHψ(r) +X
|n|̸=0Z
d3r′V(r+nL,r′+nL)ψ(r′)
r∈B∪A= ˆHψ(r).
(13)
The exact finite-volume bound state ψL(r) has an en-
ergy−E(L) that depends on the size of the box. We
relate the infinite and finite volume-binding energies via
E(L) =E∞+ ∆E(L), (14)
where ∆ E(L) is called the energy shift and has been
investigated extensively for various systems [1, 23, 24,
31, 32]. In the derivation that follows we therefore treat
∆E(L) as a known quantity and we will frequently make
use of the fact that
∆E(L) =O 
e−κL
. (15)
The finite-volume wave function must be a solution
to the finite-volume Schr¨ odinger equation with energy
−E(L) that obeys the periodic boundary condition. In
the remainder of this section, we work out an ansatz for
this periodic finite-volume wave function that will form
the basis for our derivation of the radius volume depen-
dence.
Asymptotic solution Based on the observation that
the infinite and finite-volume Hamiltonians are equal in
the asymptotic domain, we make the ansatz that an
asymptotic solution in finite volume is of the following
form (analogous to what is used in Refs. [33, 34, 36],
based on the “linear energy method” of Ref. [37]):
ψasm(r) =χA(r)"
ψ∞,asm(r)
+ ∆E(L)d
dEψE,asm(r)
E=E∞#
+O 
∆E(L)2
.(16)

This means we consider the wave function as a function
of the energy and relate the volume dependence to an
energy dependence via E=E(L), allowing us to Taylor-
expand around infinite volume and keep the linear termexplicitly. We include χA(r), the indicator function of
A, to conveniently set the state to zero outside of the
asymptotic domain. If we act on |ψasm⟩with ˆHLin the
asymptotic domain, we find
ˆHLψasm(r)r∈A=ˆHψasm(r) =χA(r)"
ˆHψ∞,asm(r) + ∆ E(L)d

(17)
Therefore, to leading order, |ψasm⟩solves the finite vol-
ume Schr¨ odinger equation with energy −E(L) restricted
to the asymptotic domain.
Now we intend to find a periodic solution based on
|ψasm⟩. We introduce a translation operator defined via

rˆT(n)ψ
=ψ(r+nL), (18)
from which it follows that

ψˆT†(n)r
=ψ∗(r+nL). (19)
It holds that
ˆT†(n) =ˆT(−n) (20)
because

ϕˆT†(n)ψ
=Z
d3rϕ∗(r+nL)ψ(r)
=Z
d3rϕ∗(r)ψ(r−nL)
=
ϕˆT(−n)ψ
.(21)
Translation operators also have the property
ˆT(n)ˆT(m) =ˆT(n+m). (22)
Using translation operators we can construct the asymp-
totic finite-volume wave function by adding shifted copies
of|ψasm⟩to satisfy the periodic boundary condition. This
leads to:
|ψL,asm⟩=X
nˆT(n)|ψasm⟩. (23)
Due to the linearity of the Schr¨ odinger equation and the
fact that the finite-volume Hamiltonian commutes with
our translation operators, |ψL,asm⟩also satisfies the fi-
nite volume Schr¨ odinger equation with energy −E(L),
restricted to the asymptotic domain.

2D analogy of the 3D scenario we consider. The central box
C, cf. Eq. (37), is shown with neighboring periodic copies
surrounding it.
Interior solution Now that we have found an asymp-
totic solution, we must find a solution for r/∈A. We need
only find an appropriate form for r∈B, since periodic
copies of this set cover AC, illustrated in Fig. 1.
By our previous discussion, we know that ψ∞(r) is an
approximate solution for r∈Bup to corrections of the
order O 
e−κL
. Specifically, by Eqs. (14) and (15) it
4
holds that
ˆHLψ∞(r)r∈B=ˆHψ∞(r) =−E(L)ψ∞(r) +O 
e−κL
.
(24)
Therefore we make the ansatz that an exact finite-volume
solution for r∈Bis of the form
ψint(r) =χB(r)h
ψ∞(r) +ϕ(r)i
, (25)
where ϕ(r) is some correction of order O 
e−κL
, the de-
tailed form of which we need not know. This state must
satisfy
ˆHLψint(r)r∈B=ˆHψint(r) =−E(L)ψint(r). (26)
Expanding the left-hand side we get
ˆHψint(r) =χB(r)h
−E∞ψ∞(r) +ˆHϕ(r)i
. (27)
Expanding also the right-hand side gives
−E(L)ψint(r) =−χB(r)(E∞+ ∆E(L))h
ψ∞(r) +ϕ(r)i
,
(28)
and combining the two previous equations we obtain adifferential equation for ϕ(r):
χB(r)ˆHϕ(r) =−χB(r)h
E∞ϕ(r) + ∆ E(L)ψ∞(r)i
+O 
e−2κL
.(29)
If we make the substitution |ϕ⟩= ∆E(L)|φ⟩, we get
χB(r)ˆHφ(r) =−χB(r)h
E∞φ(r) +ψ∞(r)i
+O 
e−κL
.(30)
Now we make the observation that the differential equa-
tion defining φ(r) is independent of Lto leading order.
If the boundary conditions on φ(r) are also independent
ofLto leading order then we can conclude that the Lde-
pendence of ϕ(r) must be limited to the factor of ∆ E(L)
at this order.
We can fix two separate boundary conditions for φ(r).
For the first one, we use the fact that parity remains a
good quantum number in finite volume, so all states will
have either even or odd parity. For even parity states,
the derivative of the wave function at the origin must
vanish along all three axes. For odd parity states, the
wave function must vanish at the origin. Since ψint(r)
andψ∞(r) have definite parities, φ(r) must also have a
definite parity by Eq. (25), and therefore we obtain that
either φ(r) or its derivatives must vanish at the origin,
and this condition is independent of L. For the second
boundary condition we impose continuity between ψint
andψL,asm:

For this boundary condition to be independent of Lto

(32)Although this is not true in general, it trivially holds for
any odd parity state since Eq. (32) evaluates to zero. We
note that it also happens to hold for a number of even
parity states, most notably the S-wave. In this paper
we focus exclusively on S- and P-waves, for which this
condition is known to hold. However, the following argu-
5
ments work for any state as long as it can be shown that
Eq. (32) holds.
Based on Eq. (30) and the boundary conditions, we
conclude that indeed φ(r) is independent of Lto leading
order for at least S- and P-wave states, and we write
ψint(r) =χB(r)h

(33)
where all leading order Ldependence is now explicitly
accounted for. Just as before, we can make this solution
periodic by adding shifted copies:
|ψL,int⟩=X
nˆT(n)|ψint⟩. (34)
Full construction Finally, we can join our two solu-
tions to get the full finite-volume wave function:
|ψL⟩=|ψL,asm⟩+|ψL,int⟩=X
nˆT(n) (|ψint⟩+|ψasm⟩).
(35)
|ψL,asm⟩and|ψL,int⟩are both periodic solutions to
ˆHL|ψ⟩=−E(L)|ψ⟩ (36)
to order O
e−√

. By linearity, |ψL⟩must also be such
a solution. In addition, |ψL⟩is periodic and continuous.
In the next section we will only need the form of ψL(r)
forr∈C, where
C=

1. Definition
In general, we define the mean squared radius of a state
as the expectation value of the operator
ˆr2=1
NNX
i=1(ˆri−ˆR)2, (40)
where Nis the number of particles, ˆriis the position
operator of the ithparticle, and ˆRis the center-of-mass
position operator. Since we work in coordinate represen-
tation we will drop the hats for these operators in the
following. For two particles, we have
r1=R+1
2r, (41a)
r2=R−1
2r, (41b)
where r=r2−r1is the relative coordinate. Plugging this
into Eq. (40), we find that the mean squared radius ex-
pectation value for two particles can be written in terms
of their relative coordinate simply as

r2
=1
4
r2
. (42)
The finite-volume radius shift ∆
r2
(L) is defined as
∆
r2
(L) =

where
r2
(L) is

r2
(L) =1

ψLr2χC(r)ψL
⟨ψL|χC(r)|ψL⟩. (44)
so ∆

The matrix elements in the numerator and denominator
of Eq. (45) can all be written in the form
⟨ψL|rnχC(r)|ψL⟩, (46)
where n= 0 in the denominator and n= 2 in the numer-
ator.
2. Expansion
Upon expanding the sums over shifted copies stem-
ming from the definition of |ψL⟩in Eq. (46), we get the
following terms

We can add zero to the first term in the form of
⟨ψ∞|rnχC(r)|ψ∞⟩=⟨ψ∞|rnχC(r)|ψ∞⟩+X
|n|̸=0⟨ψ∞|rnχC(r−nL)|ψ∞⟩ −X
|n|̸=0⟨ψ∞|rnχC(r−nL)|ψ∞⟩, (48)
which allows us to absorb the lone term into the first
sum:
⟨ψ∞|rnχC(r)|ψ∞⟩=X
n⟨ψ∞|rnχC(r−nL)|ψ∞⟩
−X
|n|̸=0⟨ψ∞|rnχC(r−nL)|ψ∞⟩.(49)
χC(r−nL) simply sums to 1 over all n, so
⟨ψ∞|rnχC(r)|ψ∞⟩=⟨ψ∞|rn|ψ∞⟩
−X
|n|̸=0⟨ψ∞|rnχC(r−nL)|ψ∞⟩.(50)
We write ⟨ψ∞|rn|ψ∞⟩as⟨rn

⟨ψ∞|rnχC(r)|ψ∞⟩=⟨rn

|n|̸=0⟨ψ∞|rnχC(r−nL)|ψ∞⟩.(51)

The first term in the square brackets on the right-hand
side contains no Ldependence, and since we do not ex-
plicitly know the form of ψ∞(r) for all r, we choose to
parameterize the entire term by a constant β′
n. More-
over, since ψE,asm(r) decays exponentially for large r,
anyLdependence introduced by the second term will
contribute only some decaying exponential in L. Since
the right-hand side overall is already contains a factor
of ∆E(L), the Ldependence from the second term turns
out to be of higher exponential order and can therefore be
dropped. Altogether, neither matrix element in Eq. (52)
directly contributes to the leading Ldependence and so
we can combine them into a single constant βn:
2∆E(L) Re⟨ψ∞|rnχC(r)|δ⟩=βn∆E(L)
+O
e−√
2κL
.(53)Turning to the third term in Eq. (47), since ψasm(r) is
always shifted by at least a distance L, and because the
second term in the definition of ψasm(r), Eq. (16), is al-
ready suppressed by a factor ∆ E(L), that part is overall
beyond leading exponential order and may be dropped.
Effectively, we may replace ψasm(r) with ψ∞,asm(r), and
we can furthermore replace ψ∞(r) with the asymptotic
form because it will only ever be evaluated in the asymp-
totic region. We therefore arrive at

where we have also made use of the fact that only |n|= 1
terms contribute to leading exponential order.
Finally, for the fourth term in Eq. (47), we can again
note that the second term of ψasm(r) will contribute only
beyond leading exponential order since it is shifted by
at least Land suppressed by ∆ E(L). Therefore, we can
replace ψasm(r) with χA(r)ψ∞,asm(r) and obtain

Note that we define ˆ ηas an operator, but choose to write
it explicitly in terms of r, with the understanding thatthis is equivalent to writing ˆrwhen we specify that ˆ η
is local in coordinate space, ⟨r′|ˆη|r⟩=η(r)δ(3)(r−r′).
Also note that the following manipulations of ˆ ηare done
with the understanding that ˆ ηwill be evaluated between
wave functions as in Eq. (61). All matrix elements are
computed in configuration space, which is what we refer
to as “integration” in the following.
We define the rotation operator ˆR(n) that maps the
vector nonto the direction of ˆz. This definition does not
uniquely describe a particular rotation, however, the am-
biguity does not matter for our purposes. For example,
we say that
ˆR(n)ˆT(n)ˆR†(n) =ˆT(ˆz). (63)
We note that
ˆR†(n) =ˆR−1(n). (64)
8
Because of this we can insert the identity ˆR†(n)ˆR(n) any-
where we would like. Inserting this identity into ˆ ηand
commuting the operators to opposite sides, we get

Depending on the actual (cubic) symmetry properties of
ψ∞,asm, some of the terms in the sum may not need to
be computed. For example, for the finite-volume ana-
log of an S-wave state (discussed in more detail below),
ˆR(n)ψ∞,asm(r) =ψ∞,asm(r) for all rotations ˆR(n), so all
the terms in the sum are identical and only one needs to
be evaluated explicitly.
4. Coordinate transformation
Now we present a coordinate system in which the quan-
tity⟨ψ|ˆξ|ψ⟩is relatively straightforward to compute in
closed form. We use a two-center bispherical coordinate
system parameterized by r,u, and ϕ, where ris the dis-
tance from the origin, uis the distance from the origin
of the neighboring periodic box in the ˆzdirection, and ϕ
is the azimuthal angle about the zaxis. The valid set of
coordinates is given by
{(r, u, ϕ )∈[0,∞)×[0,∞)×[0,2π) :r+u≥L}.(73)
9
For reference, we note that the transformation to Carte-
sian coordinates is provided by
x=s

4L2cosϕ , (74)
y=s
r2−(L2+r2−u2)2
4L2sinϕ , (75)
z=L2+r2−u2
2L. (76)
The volume element in the ( r, u, ϕ ) coordinate system has
the simple form
d3r=ru
Ldrdudϕ . (77)
The main advantage of using this coordinate system is
that
ˆT(−ˆz)r=|r−ˆzL|=u , (78)
so integrals over shifted radial functions are just as simple
as integrals over unshifted radial functions. The trade-
off, however, is that the bounds of the integration do-
main become more complicated, especially given that
not all coordinate values are valid. With this in mind,
the bounds of integration with the indicator function
χP∩A(r) become

The coordinate system described above allows us to
obtain closed-form expressions for the finite-volume ra-
dius shift for certain important cases, which we present
in the following section. We use this formalism to derive
explicit analytical expressions for the radius shift for S-
and P-wave states shown in Sec. III B, with details of the
calculation presented in the appendix.
III. RESULTS
A. Broken spherical symmetry
As already alluded to before, spherical symmetry is
broken by confining the system to a periodic cubic box,
and as a consequence angular momentum ℓis not a
good quantum number anymore. The relevant spatialsymmetry is instead described by the group of rota-
tions that leave a cube invariant. The structure of
this group is well known and has been discussed, for
example, in Ref. [38]. Angular-momentum multiplets
in general break up into irreducible representations of
the cubic group, of which there are overall five different
ones, denoted as Γ = A1, A2, E, T 1, T2, with dimensions
1,1,2,3,3, respectively. It is typically a good assump-
tion to identify S-wave ( ℓ= 0) states in infinite volume
with A+
1cubic states, and P-wave states with the T−
1
representation, where the superscript indicates positive
or negative parity.1
B. Explicit formulae
We present here analytic forms of the radius shift for
ℓ= 0 and ℓ= 1 contributions to the A+
1andT−
1cubic
representations, respectively. After calculating the radius
shift for S-wave and P-wave states using the method pre-
sented above, we find that

where ais a dimensionless fit parameter. The details
of how we arrived at these expressions are given in the
appendix. We make the following observations:
1. S-wave representations are one dimensional, and the
same is true for A+
1. All three basis states for ℓ= 1
(and therefore for Γ = T−
1in the P-wave approximation)
have the same radius shift since they are all just different
rotations of essentially the same degenerate state.
2. In general, the radius-shift formula will have at least
two additional fit parameters compared to the energy
shift. The first of these is the αintroduced in Eq. (60),
while the second is R, the upper bound of the interior

χP∩Ain Eq. (80), which is in general unknown if the in-
teraction does not have a strict finite range. Remarkably,
however, the S- and P-wave radius shift formulae still fea-
ture only oneadditional fit parameter compared to the
energy shift since we were able to absorb all Randα
dependence into a constant a, as shown in the appendix.

are exactly negatives of each other up to order

This finding is similar to what has been found for the
finite-volume energy shifts [32].
4. From the correlation between binding energies and
mean-squared radii that in infinite-volume usually means
that more deeply bound states become more compact,
combined with the known volume dependence of the
binding energy, [31, 32] one might intuitively expect the
leading radius corrections to have exactly the opposite
signs of what we found here. S-wave bound states be-
come more deeply bound in finite volume, so the naive
intuition would be that their radii would decrease , and
vice versa for P-wave states. However, the behavior we
derived here can in fact be related to how the finite vol-
ume affects the wave functions, similar to the intuitive ar-
gument that explains the sign of the energy shift [31, 32]:
Since A+
1S-wave states have even parity, the derivative
of the wave function across the boundary of the box must
be zero. This means that the finite-volume wave function
can have a larger-magnitude tail near the boundary of the
box than the corresponding infinite-volume wave function
at the same distance. Since the mean-squared radius de-
fined as the expectation value of r2relatively emphasizes
contributions from large distances, overall the radius can
increase in finite volume. For T−
1P-wave states on the
other hand, odd parity forces the wave function to zero at
the boundary, compressing the wave function profile and
therefore leading to a smaller radius compared to infinite
volume.
C. Numerical checks
Part of this work is determining the optimal strategy
for using the shift formulae for practical radius extrapo-
lations. For this purpose, we assume that we are dealing
with a finite-volume simulation that provides both ener-
gies and wave functions for the states of interest, such as
a straightforward lattice discretization of the Hamiltio-
nian or a discrete variable representation (DVR) based
on plane-wave states, an efficient few-body implementa-
tion of which has been discussed in Refs. [39–41]. Sincewe have access to the energy data, it makes sense to use
that first to extract the binding momentum κand the
ANC γ. Once κandγhave been determined, they can
be used as fixed parameters in the radius volume depen-
dence, leaving only two parameters still to be fit,
r2
∞
anda.
Determining a particular “best” fitting algorithm is
difficult due to the unknown higher-order terms and the
exponential form of the volume dependence. One option,
employed in much of the FV bound-state literature cited
previously, is to fit the data on a logarithmic scale and
focus on the large-volume region where the higher-order
corrections are smaller. However, fitting on a logarithmic
scale introduces several complications. Firstly, in order
to obtain a simple form, one generally needs to subtract
the infinite-volume value from the data. While this can
be done relatively easily for the binding energy in some
cases,2in general the infinite-volume value is one of the
fit parameters, so we do not know its value before per-
forming the fit. Even after getting past that problem,
logarithmic scales can make it very difficult to determine
constant terms, such as
r2
∞
in

r2
(L) =
r2
∞
+ ∆
r2
(L), (83)
cf. Eq. (60), because the logarithm of the right-hand side
diverges near the correct value, i.e., when the fit is near
optimal. Since the residuals may not reflect the true
quality of the fit, this fitting method tends to be unstable.
The method we propose assumes that the only source
of uncertainty comes from the unknown higher-order
terms. Therefore, it makes sense to simply minimize the
residuals on a linear scale weighted by the inverse abso-
lute value of those higher order terms. Since of course we
do not know the exact form of the higher-order terms, we
merely assume that they scale appropriately as e−√
2κL.
To illustrate this method with concrete examples, we per-
form fits using a weighted least-squares algorithm where
the weights are assigned as described above. Specifically,
we apply this procedure to perform fits of the form
E(L) = ∆ E(L) +E∞ (84)
for the energy, and as in Eq. (83) for the radius.
For our numerical simulation we use the DVR frame-
work of Ref. [39] and as concrete interaction we use at-
tractive local Gaussian potentials of the form
V(r) =V0exp 
−r
R02!
, (85)
2ForA+
1andT−
1states without Coulomb interaction, the leading
volume dependence is a pure exponential, so one can determine
the infinite-volume energy by demanding that the volume depen-
dence is linear on an (approximately scaled) logarithmic scale, as
done for example in Ref. [23].‘
11
with parameters V0<0 and R0>0. This interaction
does not have a strict finite range Ras assumed for con-
venience in the derivation of the radius volume depen-
dence, but corrections stemming from the Gaussian tails
of the potential can generally be neglected.
Example fits for S- and P-wave states are shown in
Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, respectively. Even though the fits were
performed on a linear scale, as described above, they look
excellent on the logarithmic scale that we chose to im-
prove the display and highlight the excellent agreement
of the numerical simulation with our predictions. This is
because of the exponential weighting.
The quality of the fit for the radius is particularly good
given that κandγwere predetermined by the energy fit
and the fit parameter ahas very little influence on the
shape of the curve. We see the analytic fit significantly
deviating from the simulation data only in very small
volumes due to the higher order terms and due to vio-
lating of the condition L≫R. The latter is most likely
the dominant reason because we observe that the devi-
ation occurs over approximately the same volume range
for both the energy and the radius, with comparable mag-
nitude.

manner. The radius extrapolations perform well over a
variety of volume ranges and the extrapolated radius is
consistently more accurate (compared to the reference re-

IV. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
We have studied the leading volume dependence for
the mean squared radius of bound states of two point
particles in a finite periodic box. Using an ansatz for the
wave function in finite volume and a sequence of system-
atic simplifications, we derived a general formula for the
finite-volume correction to the radius expectation value.
With the help of a carefully constructed coordinate sys-
tem, we were able to evaluate this general expression and

obtain closed-form expressions for the important cases of
S- and P-wave states falling within the A+
1andT−
1irre-
ducible representations of the cubic group in finite vol-
ume. These expressions are to a large extent informed
by the volume dependence of the energy and involve a
surprisingly small number of additional parameters that
need to be fit to numerical simulation data. As part
of this work we have performed such numerical simula-
tion using Gaussian model potentials and found excellent
agreement of our analytic results with calculations.
Our results constitute important progress towards ob-
taining precise predictions from finite-volume simulations
for observables beyond binding energies for quantum sys-
tems such as atomic nuclei. While we have studied here
explicitly the mean squared radius, our method of con-
structing an ansatz for the periodic finite-volume wave
function without explicit knowledge of the short-distance
behavior, and subsequently evaluating matrix elements
based on this ansatz, provides a recipe for deriving the
volume dependence of other static properties, such as for
example quadrupole moments.
An important next step towards implementing ra-
dius extrapolations in practical applications will be the
extension of our findings to bound states comprised
of more than two particles. Guidance for such work
can be provided by the formalism that derived the
binding-energy volume dependence for arbitrary cluster
states [23]. Moreover, recent work that studies charged-
particle bound states in periodic boxes [24] can inform
the extension of our method to such systems.
Finally, it is worth noting that radii of atomic nuclei
are typically measured using electromagnetic scattering
processes. Specifically, charge radii can be inferred from
the slope of the so-called charge form factor FC(q2),
where ⃗ qis the momentum transferred to the nucleus by
virtual-photon exchange, in the limit q2→0. Matter
radii can then be further estimated from the measured
charge radii. For theory, it is desirable to follow an anal-
ogous procedure, which compared to evaluating the ex-
pectation value of r2can ensure consistency with the
experimental determination and in particular take intoaccount a systematic expansion of the electromagnetic
current operator. Following this approach in finite vol-
ume requires understanding the volume dependence of
FC(q2), which can be informed by the results presented
in this paper.

We can absorb many of the constants that appear in this

2. P-wave evaluation
As stated in the main text, all three basis states for ℓ=
1 and Γ = T−
1have the same radius shift since they are alljust different rotations of essentially the same degenerate
state. It therefore suffices to consider just one of the wave
functions in the multiplet, the asymptotic form of which

For the P-wave state we have chosen in Eq. (A7) it holds that
ˆR(−n)|ψ∞,asm⟩=−ˆR(n)|ψ∞,asm⟩. (A9)
Moreover, ˆR(ˆz) is simply the identity operator. Using this to simplify the expression, we get

As for A+
1S-wave sates, we can absorb the constants that appear in this expression into a single constant athat needs
to be fitted. Doing that, we arrive at Eq. (82) in the main text.
