During this time she regularly coached violin with Jaime Laredo, and studied chamber music with Felix Galimir and Gary Graffman.  In an interview with PBS in December 2001, Hahn stated that of all the musical disciplines, she is most interested in musical performance (PBS Interview). \n",

      "Another musical technique he uses is the leitmotif, in which particular characters or things are linked to particular themes or musical ideas.  This technique can be very useful to suggest certain things.  For example, there is a leitmotif for the earrings which the Drum major has given to Marie.  When the major makes love to Marie we hear this leitmotif.  The music makes us realize that he is not forcing her to love him but that she is willing.  In another place, the military music tells us that Marie is thinking of the Drum major. \n",

      "John Warrack points out that Tchaikovsky put the drama in the story into music: \"By making B the key of the tragedy, he initiates a musical \"plot\" with the dark forces of Rothbart tending to drag the tonality down into flatter keys. The main action, on the other hand, lies on the key area of A.\" Tchaikovsky balanced all the musical components of the work. \"The divertissements are in his lightest, most appealing musical manner\", Warrack writes, \"The dances that further the plot have rather greater musical substance, while the scenes of narrative and action are in what was found his \"symphonic\" manner.\" Critics said Tchaikovsky's music was \"too noisy, too 'Wagnerian' and too symphonic\". \n",
