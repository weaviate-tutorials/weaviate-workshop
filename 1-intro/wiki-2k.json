    "text": "\"This City\" is the first solo mainstream radio single released by American pop singer-songwriter Patrick Stump off the debut album Soul Punk under Island Def Jam Records on July 26, 2011 on his blog. The song features American rapper and songwriter and producer Lupe Fiasco. The original track does not feature Fiasco's addition to the rap versus in the single. In January 2010, Stump announced that he was producing his debut solo album, titled Soul Punk. This came after Fall Out Boy (his main band)'s hiatus in late 2009. His album is a complete solo effort as he is doing everything: performing, composing all music, penning all lyrics, playing over ten instruments and producing, with the album's recording is funded by his own Fall Out Boy earnings. Its musical direction is generally pop/R&B orientated and has been described by Stump as \"soul punk\" and \"smart pop,\" drawing influence from a wide scope of artists including Prince, Michael Jackson and David Bowie. According to Stump, the song changed the entire course of Soul Punk. \"I had written a while draft of the album and then at the 11th hour came up with \"This City,\" I really loved the song but felt like, conceptually, it didn't fit on the album. I had to go back and make an album for that song because I loved it so much. So one of the holdups on [the album] was re-writing the record around [it].\" With Soul Punk originally due in February 2011, Stump delayed it to October 18 and rebuilt the album with the song, releasing Truant Wave EP in the meanwhile for its delay in February 2011. \"I had this feeling that the album was disjointed, and right before I was mastering, I played \"This City\" for my manager \u2014 I really liked it, but I was unsure about it, although I thought it was what I wanted to say \u2014 and he was like, 'Put it on, it's great! Then I thought, 'Well, if I'm going to put that on the record, then I really need to go back to the drawing board.' Basically I took \"This City\", \"Everybody Wants Somebody\", \"Allie\", and a song called \"Dance Miserable\", and rebuilt the album around those four songs.\"",

Strange quarks have a property known as strangeness. Strangeness causes the strange quark\u2013and all other particles bonded with it\u2013to not decay by strong force, but instead due to the much slower weak force. Since all quarks are fermions (which means that no two of them can be in the same point in space at the same point in time), each quark has a spin of 1/2, adding up to a total spin of 3/2 for a hyperon.

The Wehrmacht ordered and participated in massacres of civilians for reprisals, executions of prisoners of war, summary executions of Soviet political officers and executions of military and civilian hostages as punishment for partisan activities in occupied territories.However, the oft-repeeated claim of breaking the Geneva convention by its treatment of Russian prisoners of war is not correct.

This ability to see may be related to how females choose males.  Scientists say female H. arborea choose males with more brightly colored vocal sacs. They think colorful vocal sacs may show that the frog has enough carotenoids in the food it eats. This may mean the male frog is better at finding food than other frogs, and he might pass on some of this skill to his offspring.",

He became a major leader of the Vietnam war, and he and General William Westmoreland were the two biggest leaders in the American military during the war. In order to stop the communists from taking over Vietnam, McNamara sent more troops to the country. Over a number of years this stopped the North Vietnamese Army from winning the war, but as large amounts of American soldiers were killed the war became very unpopular with the people. He and the president strongly disagreed on troop levels - McNamara wanted to stop the increase in troops but Johnson wanted to send more over. McNamara resigned from the Defense Department in 1968. Johnson did not run for reelection that year and the election was won by Richard Nixon, who ran on a promise to end the war. Nixon signed a peace treaty in 1973, but the North Vietnamese would eventually win the war after the US pulled out.",

The teams are permanent groups. The teams meet on a regular basis to discuss the ideas and suggestions. They make decisions on approving or declining the ideas. Also the teams are given limited spending authority to approve and implement the suggestions. Suggestions that are approved by a team, but are beyond their spending authority, are advanced to a higher level in the organization for final approval. Unlike a traditional suggestion system, a team-based system does not provide individual monetary rewards. This is because everyone works together and shares in the gain together.

Lee and Kirby tried to make their comic book characters more original by allowing them to interact with each other in a realistic fashion, including heroes often fighting or arguing with each other. This trend continued with a flood of other superhero characters introduced by Marvel Comics during the early 1960s, including Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk, the X-Men and the Fantastic Four.

So far, most countries called it Sea of Japan. North and South Korea do not want this name, they suggested to call it East Sea, or East Sea of Korea. In 1992, both Koreas raised concerns about the name, at the Sixth United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names.   The Japanese government says that only the name  \"Sea of Japan\" (\u65e5\u672c\u6d77) should be used. South Korea supports the alternative name \"East Sea\" (Korean:\u00a0\ub3d9\ud574; Hanja:\u00a0\u6771\u6d77). North Korea supports the name \"East Sea of Korea\" (Korean:\u00a0\uc870\uc120\ub3d9\ud574; Hanja:\u00a0\u671d\u9bae\u6771\u6d77).

Very often, the name East Sea  is listed in parentheses or otherwise marked as an alternative.  The International Hydrographic Organization is responsible for naming bodies of water around the world. In 2012, it decided it was still unable to change the 1953 version of its publication S-23 \u2013 Limits of Oceans and Seas, which includes only the single name \"Sea of Japan\", to include \"East Sea\" together with \"Sea of Japan\".",

This theory suggests that a nation should concentrate its resources only in industries where it is most internationally competitive and trade with other countries to obtain products not produced nationally.   Ricardo promoted the idea of extreme industry specialization by nations, to the point of dismantling internationally competitive and otherwise profitable industries.  In this thinking Ricardo assumed the existence of a national industry policy aimed at promoting some industries to the detriment of others. For Ricardo some form of Central Economic Planning was a given.",

In an interview he gave to The Sun, he said that the estate he lived on was \"rough and lots of the kids I saw got into drugs or fights\". Dappy showed interest in music from a young age. He started performing around Camden Town at the age of 13 years old. He performed with band members Richard \"Fazer\" Rawson and Tula \"Tulisa\" Contostavlos, who is his cousin. At the time they were called the \"Lickle Rinsers Crew\". Contostavlos and his band-mates studied at Haverstock School. Contostavlos was forced to leave the school when he was 15, for multiple truancies and fighting. He later went back to study at college and received a GCSE A* in English. His father, Byron was, to Dappy, the \"inspiration behind the band\". With the money he made from his time in the band, Bryon set up a small studio for the band. When Byron died, the song N-Dubz wrote \"Papa (Can You Hear Me?)\" was played at his funeral. It  became the group's best hit at #19, and at #17 in the download charts. Dappy later had the words \"RIP Dad\" tattooed on his neck. He refers to his dad as \"B\" or \"Uncle B\".",

Many of the exoplanets are much closer to their parent stars and hence much hotter than the giant planets in the Solar System, making it possible that some of those planets are a type not observed in the Solar System. Considering the relative abundances of the elements in the universe (about 98% hydrogen and helium) it would be surprising to find a predominantly rocky planet more massive than Jupiter. On the other hand, models of planetary-system formation have suggested that giant planets would be inhibited from forming as close to their stars as many of the extrasolar giant planets have been observed to orbit.",

He, like virtually every German, felt Versailles was an onerous Diktat that sullied the nation's honour. However, he felt that trying to fulfill the treaty's terms was the only way Germany could demonstrate that the reparations bill was truly beyond its capacity. He also wished to recover the Rhineland - he wrote to the Crown Prince on 23 July 1923: \"The most important objective of German politics is the liberation of German territory from foreign occupation. First, we must remove the strangler from our throat\".",

After 1890 an increasingly large Swedish American community in America promoted new cultural institutions, including a lively Swedish-language press, many new churches, several colleges, and a network of  ethnic organizations. The result was to build a sense of Swedishness in the United States. This made a self-confident Americanized generation. Augustana College put itself in the lead of the movement to affirm Swedish American identity. In the early years, all the students had been born in Sweden but by 1890 the second generation of American-born students predominated. They typically had white-collar or professional backgrounds; few were the sons and daughters of farmers and laborers. These middle class youth  developed an idealized view of Sweden, characterized by romanticism, patriotism, and idealism. The new generation was especially proud of the Swedish contributions to American democracy and the creation of a republic that promised liberty and ended slavery.",

Crime rate in Russia sharply increased since the late 1980s. The fall of communism in Eastern Europe had tremendous influence on the political economy of organized crime. Approximately 8,000 criminal groups are in the country. Almost 50% of the nation's economy is connected to organized crime.",

The name Bedjau is found on the Abydos king list, Bedjatau from Giza, Netjer-Bau from the Sakkara king list and the name Bau-hetepju is on the Turin King List. A similar name, Bedjatau, is on a short king list found on a writing board from the mastaba tomb G1001 of the high official Mesdjeru. \"Bedjatau\" means \"the foundryman\". This  is thought to be a misreading of the name \"Hotepsekhemwy\". The hieroglyphic signs used to write \"Hotep\" are very similar to the signs of a pottery kiln and a chick in hieratic writings. The signs of two Sekhemsceptres were misread as a leg and a drill. This kind of misreading may have happened in the case of King Khasekhemwy, where the two sceptres in the Horus name were misread as two leg-symbols or two drill-signs. The Abydos king list copies this Old Kingdom name form of \u201cBedjatau\u201d. The names \"Netjerbau\" and \"Bau-hetepju\" are problematic, since Egyptologists can't find any name source from Hotepsekhemwy's time that could have been used to form them.",

However, the alphabet has been changed heavily in order to accurately show Vietnamese pronunciation. Some letters and digraphs make very different sounds than what most readers of the Latin alphabet expect, such as D, R, and GI. One letter has been added, \u0110, to show it is a completely different sound from D. Vowel markers are added in order to distinguish different vowel sounds like A, \u00c2, and \u01cd. Tone markers are also added, because Vietnamese is a tonal language, such as \u00c1, \u1ea2, \u00c3, \u1ea0, and \u00c0. Some vowels have both a vowel marker and a tone marker. For example, the vowel \u01cd can be written as \u1eae, \u1eb2, \u1eb4, \u1eb6, and \u1eb0. Sometimes, even non-speakers of Vietnamese can tell something is written in Vietnamese simply based on how many markings a word can have.",
